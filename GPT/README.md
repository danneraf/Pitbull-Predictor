Unfortunately, pytorch_model.bin files will not upload to Github. Those files have been uploaded to Google Drive and can be downloaded through [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8KPsc0YbbWP8XO5G-NVqzCVg-nuqoTj/view?usp=sharing). That link will lead you to the file required in the GPT folder in order for the Streamlit app to work.
