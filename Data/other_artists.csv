I know you told me I should stay away

Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none

But it's difficult, so difficult

Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Waiting for my man on the moon

One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)

I remember that way you was walking by
Ooh, girl, watch out now
You looked at me, turned around and smiled
Gave me eyes, my heart went wild
Hypnotized, this love starts now
And how do I know you're real?
It really doesn't matter, it's the way I feel
You make me feel super like the Man of Steel
You got me going stupid picking daffodils

I guess I got time for a fan or two
I roll with 3 hoes like Santa do
Ho Ho Ho and a bottle of goose
Mix it with the bull if you wanna get loose

I roll with the best click flow so impressive
Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick

They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that's why I dress so fresh, kid
You see that girl over there she big chested
Let's start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, ""I'm molested!""

Designer draws, and diamond rings
Go to the mall, lots of things
I stay the same, call it pocket change, nigga (Pocket change, nigga)
I never ever been a bitch, my last girl was, so player had to switch
Probably only with me cause I'm rich, now she only on my booty call list
Yeah, mo money don't stop the show
But she still can ride my banana boat
She still can ride my banana boat
Now her new nick name is banana throat
Clear it out
I'm the one everybody here about, man you're just here for now
So simmer down, Verizon flow, you hear me now
I'm always up to something, we got Goon in the house cause he my cousin
We got dimes by the dozens, but without you girl, I'm nothing

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Everybody's on the floor, I can see your hands up
From the stage to the door
Calvin Harris on the decks
LMFAO is on the checks
One, two in the place to be
It pays to be, what's happening next
Baby you look so fine, I can tell with that look in your eye
That me and you in the bathroom
Has crossed your mind
I rock a chain on my chest
Cause I'm fresh to the death
And everyday I'm shuffling, I'm like a soldier with these steps
It's on and popping, there ain't no stopping
That bass is knocking, the shots are dropping
Some of us came to celebrate, but most of us came to get away
[Chorus: Redfoo]
It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

[Outro]
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you

Just cause a guy got a suit and a tie don't mean he gonna tax ya

Yeah, I get crazy wild, anything for the fans to make them smile
Goose and girls, that's my style, if you think I'm a thug, then you in denile
But you know when push come to shove, we protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge, or celebrate life and hit the club

All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

[Verse 1]
Yo, it was all a dream, I used to play chess at the coffee bean
And as my coffee steamed I thought about my life and my lofty dreams
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to AM; rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays, to make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me the secret, popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin', after that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes
We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast are feelin' good, ha-ha LMFAO
I'm a pro with this party thang
I love Cherry Tree Cola and Bacardi mayne
Hey, I've been the same before the start of fame
The only that has changed is we changed the game
You and I and the crew that I roll with
It's gonna be the the same crew I grow old with
Memories fade like old leather
But the music that we make gonna last forever... legacy

Nowadays I'm stylin' and when she naked it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks then you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted-up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles on ice when we rollin' up
Cheers, a toast to us
Oh, we winnin' now
My whole life's changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans say don't let em change you
Been from London to Japan and I'm still the same dude
And he's still the same Foo
Struggles we came through
Stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true

[Verse 1]
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
You might also like[Verse 2]
Wait, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore

So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Walk into the club
Pocket full of bands
Wasn’t for me
Just my friends
Saw this little thing go
Round round round
Fine little body rocking
Up and down
When I make it over
Now you got a crowd
Why you gotta hit em with the
Looks so loud
Why you gotta make em go
Broke right now
Why you gotta tease em cause
Can't touch now

Got My Grip

You’ll get it
Never throw green but tonight I’m with it
Staring at me
Yeah I get it
My money
Now I’m about to give it
Glad I get to see two grinds at one time
Fictional thoughts of how to make you mine
Oh My Gawd
You Fine
Now let me see you do that move one more time time time time

Will you be the one
If I’m only here one night
Look so good in out the red light
Making it rain till the pockets feel light
Cause bands bands bands

You wanna hate on the status

On the planet
Man I laugh at all this
Not giving respect
And when its due
You dismiss I swear you planed this

Make no mistake too much on my plate to procrastinate
Only a few can Relate when trying to elevate
You need to concentrate calculate Formulate
Thats how you dominate
Now take a break

And let that Marinate

Yo mr none motivated
I'm fascinated
Why you over in the Corner
Frustrated and irritated
Is it because of the cards that i Hold and you hate it
Or cause your bank role and your little muscle You got is deflated

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, ooh, whoa

Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together

Chasing the stars, chasing the stars

Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo

Really, is you really with the shit, though?
We got champagne and vodka
Goons with me if they need a problem
Fuck niggas, hate real niggas, get money
All muhfucking day
Baby drop it to the ground like yass, bitch
Back it up like yass, bitch
After the club, I'll smash it
We don't cuff hoes, we pass it

Kinda funny 'cause I used to freak my teachers out

Peace to the one Black Chiney and the heaters out
In the club, everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain't talking 'bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I'm talking 'bout the shit you snort and go ""ha ha ha ha ha ha ha""
I mean just go bonkers
Make the young girls wild, and then go topless
Make the dope boys smile they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas

Mas é cheio de história e de porém
Virou covarde, tô com vontade
Mas você tá demorando uma eternidade

Não vou te esperar, tô cheia de opção

Daddy Yankee, Anuel AA & Cosculluela]

[Intro: Anuel AA, Hector El Father & DJ Luian]
Cuando ustedes me ven, yo sé que tiemblan
El que tenga miedo a morir, que no nazca
Dinero, puta', chipete' y AK
Bebecita, al que te toque vo'a quemarle las pata'
Tengo una 40 to'a negra como Baby Rasta
Un fuletazo y lo voy a dejar haciendo gimnasta
Te dejamo' la cara como pasta
Tengo presidentes muerto' pa' comprarte a tu gata
Mulata, fuma conmigo y se arrebata
Un fantasmeo en el expreso y te rompemos la lata
(This is the remix, ¡ja!)

[Coro: Hector El Father]
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no—Tú no—Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Tú no metes cabra, saramambiche
Y si te me 'esbocas, nos vamos al switche'

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
(DY; winter is coming)
Tengo una letra corrupta, me dio ejemplo el gobierno
El night walker, por ahí viene el invierno
Dictadura lirical, de nadie dejo rastro
Soy Mussolini, Stalin; soy Fidel Castro
Maduro me lo mama, yo sí soy un genocida
Rapero que me tira, rapero que pierde la vida, hah
Son parte de mi colonia (Colonia)
Les robo la pauta en la pista
Psicópata a la vista, poder imperialista
El Yankee, el verdadero terrorista
¿Qué tengo que hacer (Hacer)
Pa' que digan que soy real?
¿Hablar de matar, con cualquier metal, buscarme un caso estatal
O cumplir con Anuel en la federal, ah? (Eh)
Pupilos, sigan aprendiendo 'el teacher (Teacher)
Lo' haters son pussie' y buscan que me los chiche
Haré como Ozuna, darte un palo por pitcher
O un microfonazo por saramambiche

Pero, mientras yo estoy en Miami pisando Buscemi
Ustedes están ahorrando pa' los peines de la semi

[Intro]
Yeh, yeh

[Verso 1]
Diez en punto de la noche y salgo como de costumbre
Prendas en diamantes que cieguen cuando me alumbre
Me diferencio de la muchedumbre
A mi estilo puede que no te acostumbre'
No sé si irme en el Mercedes o en el Maserati
Modelos extranjeras que me dicen ""Papi""
Están tirando al cel, ya me quieren ver (Ah)
Seguramente, ya están locas por coger
Pero soy yo quien les llevo la champaña
Si no es con Moët, la rubia no se baña
Me voy de viaje y a las dos hora' me extraña
O mejor dicho, el dinero que me acompaña
Soy todo un Fazza en la ciudad del sol
No voy a tiendas, pues yo soy dueño del mall
Soy Cristiano después de meter un gol
Tengo a francesas hablándome en español
Y siempre mucho Gucci, mucho Ferra', Louis Vuitton
Yo no uso Retro, pero tengo to'a la colección
Pa'l Khalifa Kush tengo la conexión
Pa'l avenue Miami Beach e' mi dirección (Ah)
Todo es superficial, nada real
Nada raro que el dinero no pueda comprar
Penthouse con vista al mar
Es lo único que tengo pa' poder pasar

Otra noche en Miami (Yeh)
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche sin ti
Otra noche sin ti

[Verso 2]
Supuestamente, ya yo te olvidé
Pero son las 11:34 y de ti me acordé (Yeh)
No te veo desde que me mudé
Pero soñé contigo anoche y te saludé
Tratando de sellar las cicatrices
He estado con modelo' y con actrices
Seguramente, yo nunca las quise
Seguramente, no sé ni por qué lo hice
Y en el garage está el Bentley que tanto querías
Me monto pa' fumar, imaginando que lo guías
Ya me cansan los threesome' y las orgías
Ya me cansa que mi vida siga vacía
Y recuerdo que me lo decías
Que si no cambiaba, te perdía
Como quisiera volver a esos días
Ahora que soy rico, no tengo lo que tenía
Pues mi Rolex no brilla igual que tu sonrisa
Y con estas putas no me gusta compartir la frisa
Si piensas volver, me avisa'
Mientras yo sigo solo
[Coro]
Otra noche en Miami (Yeh)
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche en Miami
Otra noche sin ti
Otra noche sin ti
Otra noche sin ti (Otra noche sin ti)

Cuando yo la vi
Dije, ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien

'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

[Verso 1]
Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque

[Intro: Arcángel, Daddy Yankee]
(Let 'em know, pa')
Yo sí soy de la calle, lo que no soy es gangster ni matón
(Welcome to the remix!)
No te confundas, tampoco alicate ni mamón
Yo soy cantante, te lo demuestro en mi canción
(History, baby!)
A nadie envidio, por eso Dios me da la bendición (Ey)
Tengo dinero, huélemelo
Sin necesidad de tirarle a ningun cabrón
Yo soy Arcángel (Prra), mago en esta pendejá'
Los desaparezco sin esforzarme na'
Así que estáte quieto (Okay)
Que si te pillo por mi callejón te van a mandar un rafagazo
Estáte quieto (P.R.)
Arcángel ""La Maravilla"", protagonista de tu fracaso

[Coro: Daddy Yankee & De La Ghetto]
Tú sabes que somos de calle (Daddy)
Hay cría y corazón (Making history!)
Siente el fuego (¡Haciendo historia!)
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo
(¿Ustedes quieren mas presión, ah?)
(You know what time it is, G; you know what time it is, Daddy)
Porque somos de calle, hay cría y corazón (Se unieron las fuerzas)
Siente el fuego (De La Gezzy)
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo (Let 'em know, pa')

No soy sicario, pero jalo cuando es necesario
No quiero ser temerario, solo un talento de barrio
No te equivoques (No-no)
Rambién tengo pistola' en mi inventario
Y en el periódico, en la sección de obituarios
De tu corillo encontraras a varios (A varios)
A los cobardes que en vez de cojones parecen tener ovarios
De niño viví la calle a diario
Cambié la Glock por el micrófono, ahora mato en escenario'
Crías, desarrollé y no fue culpa mía
En Villa España y La Perla joseando to' los día'
Mataron a mi socio Ciquitrilla
¿Sabes qué? Que esa muerte pudo haber sido la mía

[Verso 2: Guelo Star]
Aquel que rompe las reglas, la regla es rómperle la cara
Lechones que roban, pícale las manos a fuerza 'e bala
Para verle la cara soltando lagrimas de embuste
Usted necesita insecticida
Mosquitos que cargan el dengue y pervete boconeo
El respeto no se recupera a la hora del fogoneo
Mi calle es calle y mi ciudad es peor, yo vengo de Ponce
Mi calle es de nativa, arriba Boricuaronce

[Verso 3: MC Ceja]
Soy de la calle, hell yeah, I'm from the block
Where niggas got big guns that pop and get your ass dropped
Donde se aprende a josear y a hacer dinero
También donde se aprende que el listo vive del más sincero
Yeah, but we don't talk to the cops
No importa si me quieren dar tiempo en la federal (Ah-ah)
Yeha, no doubt, soy un talento de barrio
Y en el bloque me mantengo a diario, nigga
[Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Tú sabes que somos de calle, (¡Daddy!; P.R.)
Hay cría y corazón, siente el fuego
(Nosotros somos los que comandamos en la brea)
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo (Los favoritos del pueblo)
Porque somos de calle, hay cría y corazón
Siente el fuego, las reglas del juego las pongo yo
(Hey yo, Voltaje, let 'em know!)

[Verso 4: Voltio]
(Julio Voltio)
Por eso, como Yankee, es que yo soy mudo, ciego y sordo
Y ando calla'íto aunque haya un motín abordo
En mi carro, los reguero' se tapan con un toldo
Muchos se escrachan' guilla'os de pejes gordo'
Los barrios, los caseríos, to's son iguales (Claro)
Siempre hay un chota, mil anormales
El punto, los rifles, enemigos, los federales
Cuando hay problemas, hmm, nadie sale

[Verso 5: Ñejo]
Por el dinero las mujeres dan culo
El bichote, el gangster, el chulo, el mundo es tuyo
La pendejá' es que to' el mundo piensa como tú y yo
To el mundo quiere buscarse lo suyo
Ahí es que empiezan los murmullos
Peleando por flejes, por chavos, por droga
Y dicen que es por el orgullo
Te clavan la jeva, te matan de espalda
Esto es una selva, aquí nadie te salva
[Verso 6: Chyno Nyno]
(Come on!; Chyno Ny'; yo, ah)
Muchos aspiran llevar este tipo de vida
Aquí las opciones no varían y la pobreza me obliga
No toleramos listería
Si eres chota, en la boca; si eres comelón, en la barriga
Muchos dicen que son lineas, pero se viran
Dicen ser calle y todavía no han visto la avenida
Calma la mandíbula, parlanchín
Que uste' no tiene corazón ni en el día de San Valentín

[Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Tú sabes que somos de calle, hay cría y corazón
Siente el fuego, las reglas del juego las pongo yo
Porque somos de calle (Ok, ¿tú quieres más tensión, entonces?)
Hay cría y corazón (Hey yo, Coscu, come on, man)
Siente el fuego (I got your back, man)
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo (Let 'em know)

[Verso 7: Cosculluela, Daddy Yankee]
Ya yo estoy harto de escuchar los cuentos de bichotes feka
De cuando bajaban kilos y aparatos de manteca
En las maletas, el micrófono de cable adentro 'el hoodie
Y el tipo tiro al medio hasta los tecatos en El Churry
Loco, esta gente creen que dan corriente y tienen cría
Se juntan 15 pa' asaltar una panadería
Rifle y baterías, y andan sin los tintes en el Kia
Por insecterías de esas los dejan tira'os de día
Es que en el barrio todos saben cómo el humo se bate
Hay muchos bajo tierra por hacer disparates
Te pones pa' tu número o te parten el remo
Esto es P.R., tú sabe' cómo lo hacemos (La punto 40)

[Verso 8: Baby Rasta]
El que abre la boca poniendo nombre en tu récord
Y hasta te he visto saliendo pa'l colmado con chaleco
Sé que tiemblas cuando en el barrio suenan Los Lobos
Le diste a doce, pero ¿a cuántos miraste a los ojos?
Oye, Eme, esta' gente si son thrillie, me dan risa
Buscan vida con collares, pero serán ceniza'
O se alinean o serán fantasmas con la brisa
Temperatura arrasa y Yankee los arropa como trizas

[Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Tú sabes que somos de calle, (Daddy Yankee no es un cantante)
Hay cría y corazón (Daddy Yankee es un movimiento)
Siente el fuego
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo (Damas y caballeros)
Porque somos de calle (Se les agradece el apoyo al jefe)
Hay cría y corazón (Cerrando con broche de oro)
Siente el fuego
Las reglas del juego las pongo yo (Rompiendo las reglas)

[Verso 9: Daddy Yankee]
Hey, chamaco, si las pistolas no están a dieta
Se comen vivo a cualquiera que se le trepe las chuletas (¡Gangstersito!)
Sembraste el miedo con tu locura
Pero no te respetan, papi, como al jodedor de altura
(¡Gangstersito!)
Pasaste el límite
Un sapo no puede mear en tierra 'e príncipes
Si en la guerra fuiste partícipe (Ajá)
Le metiste mucho voltaje al de'o índice
Ahora por tu cabeza hay una subasta
Están ofreciendo cash (Cash), kilos y libretas de Baby Rasta
Caliente pa'l pecho como el ron añejo
O mueres como un valiente o vives como un pendejo
Y como está la cosa, cualquier hijo del vecino
Te almuerza bien fácil como Pepper con arroz chino
Te vuelan las cejas, se viven la movie like Guelo
Con Arcángel te salve del fuego De La Ghetto

[Coro: De La Ghetto, Daddy Yankee & Ñengo Flow]
Llegamos a la disco
Tú sabe' que esto 'tá encendío'
Mujere', mano arriba que eso e' mío
Un par de bluntes 'e krippysillo, again (Nos fuimo' lejos)
Ya estamo' en la disco
Muchas botella', el combo bien arisco (Let's go)
VIP, muchas falda', muchos gistro'
Este es el combo más cabrón que se haya visto, again (Los De La Nazza, pri-pa-pa-pa-pa-pai)

[Verso 1: Ñengo Flow & Daddy Yankee]
Llegamo' a romper, luciendo bien elegante
La disco se resplandece cuando brillan los diamante' (Ñengo Flow; ey, yo)
Sé que quiere fuego la chamaca, se pone bien demoníaca
Si nos ven gastando paca' junto a Daddy (Ajá)
To' el mundo pa'l party, vamo' a romper la disco
Gata que pille en mi zona, rebuleando la confisco
Nos pusimo' pa' la calle y nos quedamo' con to' (Jaja)
Nos pusimo' pa' la disco y nos quedamo' con do' (Jaja)
Las gatas quieren a Ñengo pa' que les dé con to' (Jajajajaja)
Y si te guilla' 'e payaso, pues, te pasamo' el crop (Prr)
Las gatas quieren a Ñengo pa' que les dé con to'
Y si te guilla' e' payaso, pues, te pasamos el crop (Real G4 Life)
Seguimo' encendío', las gata' quieren fuego (Jaja)
Y tú bien sabe' que ya yo no estoy pa' juego'
Seguimo' encendío', las gata' quieren fuego
Un poco 'e candela, mami, y después nos vemo' (Arcángel)

Mira quién llegó, soy yo, el dueño 'el party (Let's go, come on; jaja)
Papi Arca (Yo), Mr. Cash and Carry
Siempre activo (Yah), no me gustan las pali (No)
Con un flow más puro que el perico 'e Cali (Jaja)
Ya no me cabe un sello más en el pasaporte (No)
Gastar y hacer dinero pa' mí es un deporte
Sin corte, le damo' duro al que se ponga torpe (Prra)
Fuletazo pa'trá', martillazo y golpe (Okey)
Y 'tamo duro, no jugamo' (No)
Contamos un par de mile' mientras vacilamo' (Yessir)
Muy fuerte, socio (Ya tú sabe'), sin ir al gym
Repartiendo reggaetón de Puerto Rico a Pekín (Uff)
¿Que estoy mal? Socio, te están mal informando
¿Tú no ve' en la ostia que yo ando? (Jajaja)
¿Tú no ve' en la pendejá' que me estoy desplazando? (Brrum)
Tú te lo imagina', pero no sabe' lo que estamo' facturando, prra
(Chin-chin; ¡wuf!)

[Puente: Farruko & Daddy Yankee]
Aún hay luna llena y salimos a cazar (Farruko)
Au, actívense, solteras, que vamos todos pa' allá (One, two, three, let's go)
Entra to' el combo a la disco y ya to' el mundo sabe quién llegó, woh-oh
Rápido las gatas vienen y se pegan porque saben quiénes son, woh-oh (De La Ghetto, let's go!)

Este es el combo más cabrón que se haya visto, again (¡Prr
Ra!; prra; let's go)
[Verso 3: Baby Rasta & Daddy Yankee]
Me meto cuatro pepas pa' romper la discoteca
Me busco una lobita con el cuerpo de Aletta
Y como bailas tú, así es que me calienta
Me son sus beso' que me saben a menta (Jaja)
Ando con la RIAA, El Mago, por si inventan
Con Kendo Kaponi, Gringo y mi .40
Los mato con El Cangri, el dueño de la imprenta (The boss)
Somos los duraco', así que págano' la renta (Okey; ¡wuh!)
Hemo' aprendido a jugar con fuego
¿Quieren fuego? Fuego, fuego caliente les metemo' (Jaja)
Sientan la intensidad pa' enviarlo' hasta el cielo
Les metemo', le' hacemo' canto los sesos (¡Los Lobos!)
¡Gringo, cómetelos!

[Verso 4: Gringo & Daddy Yankee]
Abracadabra y dobla el lomo
Te encanta la forma en que yo te sobo
Y al frente de tu jevo yo te robo
Yo ando con la letra, El Mago, tu gatito es un flojo
""Los Rompe Discotekas"" ahora se llaman ""Los Lobos"" (¡Au!; jaja, let's go!)
Y estamo' encendío', el que no ande con nosotro' 'tá jodío'
Le-Le-Le-Le doy dos cruzá' y lo remato en el piso, chico
U-U-U-Ustede' son hijos míos
Llegó el dúo de la historia, Baby Rasta y Gringo
[Verso 5: Alex Kyza & Daddy Yankee]
Kyza-Kyza-Kyza pa' la disco con los Goodfellas
Mucho-mucho rosé y treinta botellas (Kyza)
Una onza 'e kush, me la fumo completa
Masacre Musical, control de la discoteca
Shorty, mano arriba, le gusta mi flow de ronco (Yes)
Quiere más swing, tranquilo, yo se lo pongo (Okey)
Yo sí la perreo (Oh), pa' que sienta el tronco (Wuh)
Y me hago el loco, pitcher como Randy Johnson (Nah)
Un piquete fuerte, homie, what you think? (What you think?)
Me creo Will Smith, me dicen el Fresh Prince (Sup?)
Pero se confunden y te meto el clip (Shh-shh)
Y cuando ves el flash, no es la cámara, click
El capitán del equipo, young Derek Jeter (Yes)
De La con la torta, Alex Rodríguez (Ah)
A mí no me tocan, me voy por encima
Kyza en el track como una bomba en Hiroshima (Mano arriba, let's go!)

[Coro: De La Ghetto, Daddy Yankee & Kendo Kaponi]
Llegamos a la disco

Este es el combo más cabrón que se haya visto, again (Kendo Kaponi; ¡Los Lobos!)

[Verso 6: Kendo Kaponi & Daddy Yankee]
(Los Lobos)
I have more than de un par de parties que se desbordan
Hasta las Hayabusa las mandé a pintar de Jordan
Ya lo saben, pa' cuando la vea', la identifiquen
A ver si son bravo' y me derriten (Jajajaja)
Ellos dicen que me falta (Let's go again)
Y yo estoy tan cabrón que de meterme a la cabina el micro y el Pro Tools se trancan (Dile, Luian)
Ella me dice: ""Demonio, dame duro en la pista
Hasta virarme los ojo' como El Exorcista
Dale, rico y con odio, bájala más lento""
Yo llego a la disco, me paro en la esquina y parece que estoy en el centro del momento
Tu gato ha visto con cuánto' yo entro
Y lo fácil que sería mañana sacarlo por Noticentro (Jajaja)

[Puente: Kendo Kaponi & Daddy Yankee]
Tengo un mensaje pa' tu combo
Prende el celu y ponlo en speaker
Yo 'toy pega'o sin bajar un zipper
Y ustedes se caga-ga-gan cuando El Mago les manda por Twitter, ¡au! (Jaja)
Tengo un mensaje pa' tu combo
Prende el celu y ponlo en speaker
Yo 'toy pega'o sin bajar un zipper
El combo de Al Qaeda, ah-ah, sale el demonio tiburón y se esconde, flipper (Jajaja, ¡au!)

Ey, yah

[Verso 8: Daddy Yankee]
El hombre más influyente por la revista Times y CNN
Tú puede' clonearme, pero no tienes mis gene'
En resumidas cuenta', esto no es el más que suene
Vamo' banco a banco a ver quién es el más que tiene (¡Oh!)
Pagué la botella y la mesa y mi combo comienza a peliculear
Como si hubiéramo' gana'o la Serie Mundial
Me fui pa'l espacio con Los De La Nazza y de nuevo a romper el beat
El hombre clutch que necesitan los Miami Heat
Eres famoso, sí, sí, me han habla'o de ti, ti
Tiene' nombre y apellido, ¿quién? Mr. Huelebi-bi (Jaja)
¿Viste? Soy el rey de los views
Tus mejores cancione' vi que no sobrepasan mis previews
Con mi carro new por el avenue
Voy gritándole a esto' envidioso' ""fuck you!""
Y está la flota bien activá' de Ferrari y Cadillac
Con más fulete' que Irak, somos en la calle la autoridad (Ey)
Siente el peso de mi voz (Ey), puncha y vete, llegó El Boss
Pa' los business soy veloz, y en la tarima dangerous (Tú sabe')
Tu combi no vale ni un penny
Y hasta Rafael Nadal vio que soy campeón en tenis (Is the Wimbledon)
De Europa a Suramérica y USA
Prestige, el disco duro, lo quiere hasta Bill Gates (DY, the president)

[Coro: De La Ghetto & Daddy Yankee]
Llegamos a la disco
Tú sabe' que esto 'tá encendío'
Mujere', mano arriba que eso e' mío (Dime, baby)

Tiene algo malo, te hablaré claro

Dijeron que en el cuartel
Tienen una foto con mi nombre
Porque desapareció un buen hombre
Aquel pasado yo lo maté
Las gatas no caben en la piscina (Yeh)
Parece la NASA mi marquesina (Woh)
Alquilo el amor sin dar propina
Cambié por el poder de una vagina
Yo no soy para ti, tú no eres para mí, no cabes en mi king
En el juego de damas cuando una me llama la hago mi queen
De todo lo vivido ya aprendí (Ya aprendí)
La realidad, que en el mundo vivimo' así

Llámale ""poca mujer"", pero ella me levantó

[Coro]
Tú sabes que somos de calle, hay cría y corazón
Siente el fuego, las reglas del juego las pongo yo
Porque somos de calle, hay cría y corazón
Siente el fuego, las reglas del juego las pongo yo

[Verso 1]
Brega legal, o nos vamo' a lo ilegal
Esto es negocio, pa', no lo cojas personal
Y yo sé que hoy día estás aquí, mi pana
Y no sé si por bravo no estás mañana
¿Qué es lo que quieres? Yo sé qué tú quieres
Dinero-dinero es lo que to' el mundo quiere
So, glotón, verás tu final por la ambición
La ambición es el primer paso a la traición
Sí, señor, por eso es que los revientan
Pues, no puedes morder la mano que te alimenta
Y aquí no puede' romper la palabra de hombre
Pues, con tu vida puede ser que a ti te la cobren
No dañes tu récord, pa', con un anormal
Las leyes de la calle no son las del tribunal
Aquí los jueces dictan las sentencias con fuego
En duelos es donde no existe el arreglo ni el consuelo

[Verso 2]
Hay quien nace pa' líder, otro pa' seguidor
El segundo es tu gran admirador (Ajá)
Pasa el tiempo y te exigen posiciones
Le enseñas algo y te quieren dar instrucciones
Brinca cuica, serruchador
¿Se te olvidó cuando me pedías un favor? (Lambón)
No te estoy sacando en cara lo que por ti hice
Te estoy acordando, pa', que usted no sirve
Pase lo que pase, a nadie le doy la espalda
Ni traiciono a un hermano, socio, por una falda
Se envuelven en estupideces y te fallan
Se creen que se lo merecen y se engañan
Y en la calle, te los comías vivos
El fiscal te metió presión con el tecnicismo
Terminaste senta'o en la silla 'e los testigos
Vaya, qué lindo nombre le pusiste al caserío

Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, ""Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)

Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me

Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—

But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)

Rice and peas, macaroni cheese, collared greens
No she don't bullshit
She Steph Curry with the curry chicken
She just make a whole bunch of good shit
I been out the ghost, I got the rice sitting on the tow truck
Had to hit me with some bands
He can get me that brown paper bag
Get me more bucks
I'm goin fine, securing lines with my zoes bro down in Florida
I stack it, stack it, pack it, pack it, stack it, pack it, stack it, pack it, in that order
Hold up, I'm all the way up
I need to put something in my soda
I don't need no lunch, Ima go get a bunch of Asian bitches up in the Rover
My legacy, fuck that
They thought that T-pain wasn't gon' to come back
Now go tell them that when you run back
You a hoe, so you already done that

I need to put something in my Sprite, bitch
If you think you're doing it, I'm about to ruin it

I got bitches in the Bronx, nigga

Rob a nigga in the trap house, bitch you just walked in the trap door
Cross the body in the Bugatti, go put the bricks in the wrapper
Thought they was sleepin on Pizzle
Somebody go ask these niggas what they takin' a nap for
Illuminappy, that the squad, nigga
Without that shit I would've been dead
But I swear to God I'ma keep killin' niggas and I put that shit on my kid's head
Cash Know. I'm an asshole. So don't fuck with Pizzle and his bread

Yea, I'm all the way up
¿Dónde estás, mi amigo?
Don't put your eye in that peephole
'Cause I'll turn the back of your head to a peephole
Then kick in the door and murk all your people
You already know the weapon is lethal
Flip the clip, cock it back, pull the hair trigger
Yeah nigga, back for the sequel, oh
I got problems in my head, nigga
Smokin' that shit from the West Coast
The major key is when you hatin' me, you could fuck around get your neck broke
You fuck around with the Winsquad, they could find your body at the Texaco
The summer comin' and you comin' with nothin'
You ready pussy-nigga, let's go

All I say is ""Panda, Panda"" and they handle-handle my shit
While I'm chillin' up in Alabama tryna show a bitch how fast a lambo can get
With all of this green up under these gold chains, they mistakin' me for the king
Bitch, I make platinum, I'm comin' after them
Passin' them, all I do is fucking win, bitch

[Verse 3: Young Cash, T-Pain, Together]
I got broads out in Cali, I got hoes gettin' ratchet
Hit dispensaries and grab it, wrap it all up in that plastic
USPS, I'm a track it
Two day priority, I have it
They’re making ‘em meet and I'm taxin'
Two hundred racks in the mattress
I don't know about y'all, but I'm a street nigga
Ain't gotta sound like nobody, I'm just me, nigga
Been on tour with T-Pain, that's for free, nigga
That's why I still fuck with them bricks and the weed, nigga
And that's why I hop in my jag, my nigga go hop in that Benz
My nigga go hop in that porsche, and no we don't need no new friends
'Cause we'll go hop in that ghost, and yeah that we'll still got the Benz
Look at that lift on the fours, look at the mothafuckin' rims
And I keep tryna tell you we from Florida, babe
Still fifty-grand sofa, now mercedes benz

From the cocaine era, I'm a eighties-baby

She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that
Super cute face and the booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Because I'm in love and that's a well known fact (like)
Yeah, she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never going back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown, can't leave it alone
Liking the way she break it down to the flooe
Need to get her over here and show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 2: Twista & (T-Pain)]
You wanna know when Twista be on fifty

I like the way she pour the honey in her naval (yeah)
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole (ooh)
Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll (ooh)
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video, you get the popular role (ooh)
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man (oh oh)
She freakin', she lickin', she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'

But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy, I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cause you get out there and do what it do

Break the trick, you gotta pay to roll
Get the money, break 'em off
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall baby
It was love at first sight when I seen that ass shakin'
And bout fifty dollars later, it was love in our makin'
Ya simply won my heart when I saw the way ya work that pole
And when you bent over, ya had my wallet in a chokehold
I saw you in your birthday suit and and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance, it's like we gone on a date
But I feel like ya cheatin' on me when I see ya dancin' with other guys

[Verse 5: R. Kelly]
I must be the first man to ever fall in love with an ass
Gonna roll down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me
That booty makes me forget about any chick I freak with in my past
Plus we got a lot in common: she’s a stripper, I’m a freak
Make me wanna grab it, I got a habit, I gotta have it
You can call me the man of steel cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn, you got me so in love, can’t stay away from this club
Every time I find myself rollin up on them dubs
I been around the world, see booty all the time
I never seen a booty so so purty so so fine
(Err-rr-rr-rr) Comin’ down the pole
No secret why I’m here cause girl you keep my donk on swole
When it drop drop, when it pop pop, and when it hop hop
Baby the way you doin’ that thing don’t you stop stop
I wanna stick it, wanna kiss it, if I could
I’d put my whole damn head in it, cause I’m in love with a stripper
[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing

I can't stay out this club, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 6: MJG]
I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin'
Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm fallin' in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'mma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin', stop the bill
If I come in here one mo' night, I'm gon' need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife

[Verse 7: Too $hort & T-Pain]
The last girl was pretty (oh) but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy (oh) but she couldn't do the thangs you do
She could dance (oh) but nothin' like the way you move
I used to want her (oh oh) until the day I saw you (oh oh)
I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all
Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall (oh oh)
And right then, I knew exactly what it was
(What's that?) I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing

I'm trying to get you out of this club
And get you up in my bed
Go ahead

Found out I was comin', sent your friends home

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit

Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target

Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision (The vision)
I think these hoes deserve another fixin' (Fixin')
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches (On bitches)
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute (Been a minute)
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz (Ooh, woah)
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)

Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Bridge]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)

'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone

I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see?
I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Bridge]
S.O.S, she's in disguise

She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, ""Ahh!"" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up

I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl

[Verso 1]
Nunca pensé que doliera el amor así
Cuando se entierra en el medio de un no y un sí
Es un día ella y otro día yo
Me estás dejando sin corazón y cero de razón

[Coro]
Ay, te aviso y te anuncio que hoy renuncio
A tus negocios sucios
Ya sabes que estoy de ti vacunada
A prueba de patadas
Por ti me quedé como Mona Lisa
Sin llanto y sin sonrisa
Que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de tí
Me voy, será mejor así

[Verso 2]
Sé que olvidarte no es asunto sencillo
Te me clavaste en el cuerpo como un cuchillo
Pero todo lo que entra ha de salir
Y los que están tendrán que partir empezando por mí

[Coro]
Ay, te aviso y te anuncio que hoy renuncio

Pero voy a intentarlo una y otra vez voy

Ah!
Well this ah di big bod Nicki Minaj (Kingston!)
And dem should know! (JR! We back.)

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
I was just a player in the game of love
'Til she came and turned mi tables around
Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cars
Still they all came tumbling down

[Pre-Hook]
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealin' me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I’m done
If love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
Fly me away, the kingdom come
She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam

[Hook]
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no, 'til love shot me down
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
I'm sayin, hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no, oh no 'til you came around
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild

Oh you everything for holding me down
I'm tellin all my homies that mi find mi a queen
In the jungle so you facing the crowd

[Pre-Hook]
Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealin' me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I’m done

Oh no, oh no 'til you came around
I’d rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
If you would die, then why would you try
And if you reply, a suit and a tie
Is what I would buy, then you will be mine
Because you and I, we're born to be wild
I am Martha; you King Arthur, who knew you would land me?
I've been known to eat these rappers, cook 'em like chef Ramsey
Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice
Cover of Vogue, yeah, I'mma go topless
I'mma go bonkers I'mma go crazy
I'mma get reckless and have a baby
Then hang the baby off of the balcony
Teachin him to moon walk, tell him he's Japanese
Yeahhh!! (Konichiwa!)

Ain't no way I'm killin' myself
If I'm thinking suicide
It must be them phantom doors
Your boy 'bout bringing toys out
Maybe they should call me Santa Claus
Picture me Cobain-ing, Belushi cocaine-ing
Why would I go blaming or even stoop to go naming?
Proclaiming shorty the reason
I'm thinking of trigger squeezing
I'm cold as winter season
Be cool as autumn breezes
I do what I pleases
Jesus, he just switch women like Regis
Life is so beautiful!

But she brighten up my day when I see her (When I see her)
Then she turn right back around and be a cheater

Girl, you've got that good-good, I can't even lie
I ain't even tripping', girl, I know I am that guy
Girl don't hold back - pull up, throw these racks
Show money, no tax - young gun, just like that
Pour it, pour it up cause all I see is dollar signs
Givenchy embalm me, and my crib stay so fly

Or I could fuck you like I don't know ya
All these chicks around don't really understand
Just say I could hold you down, don't really need no hand
Cause she move quick, elusive with no frontin'
Don't mean to beg or borrow, but I've got a little somethin'

Okay, them suckas tried to bury me, Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain't no scarin' me
Apparently, you dont understand who I am
It's trouble man hundred grand in my pan
Whippin' dropheads, hardtops, fit to sell Maybachs
Maseratis, Ferrari's those money I dont play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shining on to make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Looking for me to roll over and die, who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, came back to life
I guess this is me ballin' in the afterlife
Let's hit it

I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Verse 1: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
The kid back on the whiskey
Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci (Gucci!)
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me (Uh)
I know she wanna text me (Wow)
I know she wanna sex me
Fifty thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like, ""Next, please""
My nigga, who would've thought? (Huh?)
My nigga, who would've thought now?
I'll be right back at the top now
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single
Blowin' my phone like I'm Cee-Lo (Damn)
Somebody needs to come get her

Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first-class flight
Buh-bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
I'm in Dubai
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd probably have one hundred wives (Damn!)
Walkin' in the club and they like, ""Gucci just arrived"" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised (I'm a'ight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime (Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum)
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]

We're just counting the days, huh

80 chains going and ain't took one yet (Burr)
Ain't nothin' retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex (Huh)
A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck (Burr)
I hope you didn't pay them, 'cause they didn't have no success (Nope)
You seen my interview, nigga, and you got upset (R-I-P)
I seen your interview too, you looked oh-so-stressed
I think the nigga just mad 'cause I fucked his ex (Mwah)
And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex
Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can't say shit
And if you looking for the kid, I'll be in Zone 6 (Gucci)
I hit a birthday party fresh, you and your homeboy, Tip
I know y'all seen me over there with that black four-fif'
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tip’s
But I never went platinum—do you catch my drift? (Skrrr!)
I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip (It's Gucci)

But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love with her (Wow)
Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud with you (Haha)
I was screaming ""So Icy"" and was a neighborhood nigga (Burr)
This AR is my backup 'cause I don't need nann nigga
Must didn't hear when Flocka said, ""Let them guns blam, nigga!"" (Bow, bow)
Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams, nigga (Skrr!)
I'm just who I am, nigga, but I ain't sparing nann nigga

You left his son to be a bastard, won't even raise your own boy (Its Gucci)

It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt

Run up on me get murked

Preachin' like an evangelist

I drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas

But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
I'm so trill, your ho can't handle it
But damn, that bitch can suck a dick

Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch

But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick

Zaytoven
Hah, Wop, Trav, hah

Just took half of it (Wizzop, hah, okay)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I love when my bitch get drunk 'cause she talk greasy to me (Mwah)
Nigga with an attitude, this shit gettin' easy to me (Easy)
The last time I drunk some lean, I was out of my mind (Lean)
Tried to give me twenty years and that's a whole lotta time (Fucked)
A married woman divorced her husband to spend the weekend with me
He think it nasty when she squirt, but that shit sexy to me (Hah)
The last time I took some molly, took a gram and a half (Ooh)
Niggas think they know 'bout Gucci but they don't know the half
See, I'm an ex-X popper and online shopper (Ooh)
Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper (Proper)
Convicted felon worth 10 million, I'm a well-known robber (Wow)
Like Shawty Lo, I got 10 children
Yeah, yeah, Lo my partner, Wop (Lo)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
'Cause last time I took pills, I had to smash a bitch (Geek)
And last time I smoked gas, I almost crashed a whip (Skrrr, skrrr)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Half)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
The last time I went to Onyx, man, I ordered a dub (Ooh)

The last time I seen lil mama, she wasn't wearin' no panties
Last time I went to Vegas, spent 200k gamblin' (Wow)

Yeah, hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody
He don't love nobody (Uh-uh)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you?
Let me show you how I do this shit (Get money)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat
[Verse 4: Ester Dean]
Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot

[Verse]
I'm hearin' shooters loadin' pistols while I'm brushin' my teeth (Dang)
I get so many death threats, it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray (Nope)
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive (Lawd)
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room (Ah)
Trying to be patient, but nigga, I can't wait (Nah)
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case (Yeah)
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me or against me or you in my way (Pussy)
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree, but hell, I don't breed 'em (Grr)
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama (Mama)
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later, still don't know shot up my Hummer (Hmmm)
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take (I take)
Black gloves and black tape, nigga, it's my first day (Wop)

And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just drove the Tesla with both eyes closed (True)
Made a hundred thousand on the one-eyed stove (That's right)
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG (Tell 'em)
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Chão
Makin' money in piles, sellin' people the pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to rock just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, wore the 'Ye to the game
[Chorus: Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz & Young Dolph]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt, wow)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? True)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand (Hah)
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed (Hold up)

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Don't mean to brag and boast, but I be fresher than most (Ayy)
Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast (Trap)
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
She said, ""Let's make love"", want me to fuck with my eyes closed (What?)
But lil' mama so fine, when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it, both eyes closed
(You crazy, bruh)
Hah, wait a minute, I'm fresh as fuck, let me strike a pose (It's Dolph)
Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold (Yeah)
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe (Hah)
Since a juvenile, I stuck to the G code (Uh-huh)
Servin' out the kitchen, but I never touched the stove (Nah)
I told my bitch, ""You mines now, you ain't gotta work""
Just keep it real and let's go spend the mils
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say

But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)

(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
(DJ Meech, lil' bitch)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Them niggas get on y'all ass, y'all play with me like I ain't worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like y'all ain't said my name first
He a junkie, he ain't shot his gun yet, he blame Percs
Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first?
They like Smurk, ""Your ass be tripping, better put your case first""
Choking who? I heard them rumors, niggas better play slow
I don't want no niggas who you catch, I want the one I paid for
We on his ass, he in the A, you see how long they stay for
Ain't no hotel room, we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats, they get off any scene, the police chase those
Trolling ass, we shot your homie, we ain't know he can take those
If I say your name, don't post it, opps be on all kind of shit
Ain't got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up, literally, niggas dying to hit
In this industry, ain't what it seem, this shit be counterfeit
Ain't no lacking, she say I'm a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie, why you asking?
You got my number, you post shit on the 'Gram, you moving backwards
You lucky I don't be doing shit for the 'Gram, you niggas cowards

When his goofy ass jumped in the streets? His ass a hooper
I know this shit don't matter, I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement, he gon' kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning, wake him up, that boy a rooster (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
He took it to trial, I tried to tell him it was stupid (I knew it)
They gave him so much time, his knees got weak and he was woozy (Damn)
Watch the shit you say, the feds be listening to the music (Woah)
And they gon' take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
D.A. dropped my murder, didn't have evidence to prove it (Nah)
I think my house is haunted, yeah, by who? The ghost of Pookie (Woah)
He ain't killed nobody but keep rapping 'bout the shootings (Pussy)
Still ain't got revenge yet but keep making up excuses (Wow)
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Gucci's (Lean)
Told him quit while he ahead and don't go out like Whitney Houston (Huh?)
He got caught without it, now they robbing him for his rubies (Woah)
He wouldn't give it up so he got buried in his Cuban (It's Gucci)

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't usually do this, but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions, man, I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie, I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she acting new-school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off, I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the *brrrr*, I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now, I'm high as shit, I'm on the Bumbu, straight
I just got out my bitch, felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home, they would argue, he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now, I'm on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix, baby! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn, these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty, but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life

[Chorus: JJ Lin & Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
緩緩的掌控完美無瑕火侯
忍住呼吸卻還是氣味相投
即使不在身邊也能記住我

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

[Post-Chorus: JJ Lin & Luis Fonsi]
你的朦朧眼神每分每秒呼喚著我
玫瑰香味漫游到我心頭
我要成功闖關你的迷宮

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
[Bridge: JJ Lin]
Despacito
緩緩的掌控完美無瑕火侯
忍住呼吸卻還是氣味相投
即使不在身邊也能記住我

我要給你天空, 我要跟你轉動
我要陪你作夢, 我要讓你受寵

¡Ay!
Oh-oh, oh, no, oh, no
Hey, yeah

[Verso 1]
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

[Pre-Coro]
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído

Me quedo callado, soy como un niño dormido
Que puede despertarse con apenas sólo un ruido
Cuando menos te lo esperas, cuando menos lo imagino
Sé que un día no me aguanto y voy y te miro

[Verso 1]
Y te lo digo a los gritos
Y te ríes y me tomas por un loco atrevido
Pues no sabes cuánto tiempo en mis sueños has vivido
Ni sospechas cuando te nombré

[Coro]
Yo, yo no me doy por vencido, yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar; y esperar; y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

[Verso 2]
Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me enseñe lo que no aprendí de la vida
Que brilla más cada día
Porque estoy tan sólo a un paso de ganarme la alegría
Porque el corazón levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te vi

[Verso 1]
Como la luna y el sol
Que hasta la noche siempre tienen que esperar
Aunque no estás hoy a mi lado, yo sé que tú vas a llegar
Los girasoles nunca dejan de girar
Como en la orilla del mar
El agua viene con caricias que se van
Yo sé muy bien que tú te fuiste, tú sabes bien que volverás
Los girasoles nunca dejan de girar

[Coro]
Te esperaré, te esperaré
Y cuando vuelvas con un beso, aquí estaré
Te esperaré, te esperaré
Con la certeza que respiro, te amaré
Porque aunque sé que tú te fuiste, tú sabes bien que volverás
Los girasoles nunca dejan de girar

[Verso 2]
Como la lluvia y la flor
Una tormenta puede hacerte florecer
Y cuando ya se calma el viento, más linda tú te vas a ver
Aquí estaré, yo sé que tú vas a volver

I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been lookin' for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies

[Chorus]
I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight

[Verse 2]
I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold

And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart

You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl

Been a prisoner of the past
Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
’Til all my shit hit the fan

Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim""
Life ain’t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it

Putting crazy thoughts inside my head

I was in my yellow car, but my Ferrari go faster
Soundin' like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Ke$ha, 'bout out to go see the cashier
On the grind, so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think, ""It's time to get it""
Brought a lot of marijuana and I'm here to share it
No, it’s not a problem, better get it then, I won't be here tomorrow, lil' mama
Tahahahahaha!

[Verse 2: André 3000]
We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That Mama shot for our daddy, so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how Mama hates him
He's such a cool-ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only eight, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two-parent dwellings, expellin' have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, ""but later"" look like ""maybe""
This crazy lady named Ke$ha is guessin' my Mercedes
Would be all new and frou-frou, but it's a 1980s
But now that we are cool-cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say, ""Stacks, you’re true-blue?"" I said, ""Nah, I’m navy""
I call her ""Keisha,"" she like it because it's hood to her
She call me ""André 6000"" because I'm good to her

Well, damn
Hey Ke$ha, what up, boo? It's me
Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two with me
Witk you, better make it ""two or three""
Bad bitches know me, so don't bother introducin' me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I’m super clean
I’m hella cold, mega paid, makin' moves, doin' things
Bitches stay queued, and they all wanna do the king
I’m boiling, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special, and this dick is so impressive
Bitch, I bet you'd take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin’, I’m just here, they couldn’t catch you, and I got you
Bitch, my swag on supernatural, get you pregnant lookin' at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will

When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

The toughest role you ever played

And pain was the price you paid

Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said ""God is dead
And the War's begun""
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever

Someone saved my life tonight

So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
[Bridge]
""Boom, boom, boom""
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

Thought it was done, but I

Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Fuck you mean? Fuck your little memes
Even Queen Bey had to tell 'em I'm the queen

Then he put his hands in my pants, felt them thick lips, and got wood
He said, ""Kylie, wuss good?"" I said, ""Miley, wuss good?""

Try to beat me there, let me be clear

Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, ""What you like about me?"" He said, ""That your ass fat""
He said, ""Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?""

Poverty's paradise

Watch it fall down, but how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
In a nigga, yeah, no love in a nigga
If I could paint a picture, I'd show a image
Of a dog ass nigga, yeah, a raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs with them pistols, na-na-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
Co-cold muh'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun, fo'real
He was raised in the trenches
Not to mention, all the hoes they had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him, grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt
So holmes turned to a strap
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn

How you gon' survive now? No love, no love

My words like, multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like, a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, ""Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?""
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief
[Chorus: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Fo'real, fo'real
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
She a hustler, she don’t need no help raising her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square business, she ain’t never showed weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monsters
Got the game from our momma, that’s some ill shit
Thirteen on the block, he was a lookout
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cookout
Young nigga mastered the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over, he got took out (bang!)
Brains leaking, nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice, bet again
Win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men
[Chorus: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Outro: J. Cole]
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday, mm
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday (fly)
Oh, we can fly someday (fly)

Hold up, she gon' have to wait on it (Wait on it)
VVS diamond drippin' all over my t-shirt
Reach for it, I'ma put your face on it
Rolls Royce truck on the way, cashed out for it (Cash)
Still had to wait on it (Wait on it)
Plug fucked around, sent the wrong damn kind (Bullshit)
Nigga still had to pay for it (Hah)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hundred thousand dollars off a iPhone (iPhone)
I ain't talkin' show money (Show money)
Plug keep calling, we gon' take his ass down (Hold up)
That'll be some more money (More money)
Labels talking contracts, I ain't signing shit (Nope)
Tell 'em that I know money (Know money)
I used to shop with a bitch, she got 'em low
She kept it realer than niggas
If she get a number better than these bookings I'm gettin'
I swear that I'm floodin' the city
A rap nigga better not diss me 'cause I run with hitters
Everywhere I go, they with me
Pack comin' in on a back street (Back street)

Gettin' fifty thousand dollars for a show
Knowin' goddamn well niggas still ain't workin'
I been told these folks that I quit (I quit)
Knowin' goddamn well nigga still sippin' syrup
Got the trap goin' crazy like the first and the third
Got a lot of cash money, I could still get birds
Get away with my chain, he gon' still get murked
Had an FN on me when I did this verse
If she suck good dick, she gon' leave with a purse
I was really in the streets, you can do your research
[Chorus: Yo Gotti & Lil Baby]
Sack coming in and the money don't fold (Fold)
Gotta put a stamp on it (Stamp on it)
Just hit a play, scrape it off the plate (Skrrt)
Gotta put the camp on it (Camp on it)
Pussy ass nigga always talking that tough shit
Nigga, put a date on it (Date on it)
Everybody sittin' at the table 'round here, yeah

Runnin' through the money and the bitch keep callin'

Chea! (Yeah)
Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch, talkin' bout
(Burr! Burr!) I'm talkin' homegirl
Be lookin' like she just stepped outta magazine (Gucci!)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your head somethin' fine
This time, it's gonna be somethin' serious (yeah!)
I want a five-star bitch, I need a five-star bitch
I need a five-star bitch, I want a five-star bitch

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gotti, here go twelve bars, Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more, '09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed, might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me, best money I ever spent
Hey, I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not, yeah all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta, look up Gucci girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel, you can meet me

I'm the realest nigga walkin', and this the remix
And still I'm out here lookin' for a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her with a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla, she ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga, she ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic
That ain't a five-star bitch, that ain't a five-star bitch
That ain't a five-star bitch, girl ain't a five-star bitch

[Verse 3: Trina]
(Trina!) See I'm a five-star bitch cause I ain't that other bitch
She been strugglin' for hers, from the womb, I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money and the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina, see the proof, mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star bitch eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like ""Coming to America""
All my Louis luggage, you see my bag how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport like I'm in a parade
On my hologram, loggin' on to E-Trade

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers and my cookie's always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' ""Fuck 'em"" with a dildo sign
Five, little mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter? Harajuku hyphen Barbie
I'm hot, I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage, they was booin' and leavin'
Young Money, red flag, no more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is

Tell 'em fuck it, gon' front you the whole half
Pussy cat niggas, they got 9 lives
So I'ma try to kill 'em 9 times
Shout out to niggas on the block and the bitches in beauty shops
With rollers in their head, their niggas off in the fed
Collectin' every calls, send pictures and writin' letters
And makin' every visit, y'all the realest bitches ever, 100, 100

Oh this a hit, nigga
With no words on it

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I got on two chains, no, I ain't Tity Boi
I'm dream chasing, but I ain't from Philly, boy
Bitch bad, and she said I can get it, boy
This a hit and I'ma make a nigga feel it, boy
My flow deranged, my swag insane and my campaign on ten
I like the bitch, she bad as fuck, but I'm really into her friend
House up on the hill, got it off of cocaine
Aventador Lamborghini, condo off of Biscayne
Bitch, I'm in my lane, fresh as hell, no stains
Robin's Jean with the stones, Giuseppes match my chain
I’m different, I was built for this, my bitch only rock Tiffany
You a rat, you’ll sing a symphony
And I’m back, street's been missing me
My watch silly, my clock ignorant, and I'm the king of my city
I'm ban'd up and I ain't in a band
But my flow just like an instrument
Bass, feel that, yellow tape of the trizack
Hating is a disease, pussy, where they do that?
(L.A. Reid, cut the check for me)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
King shit and you know what it is
Shorty smell like a pound of that loud
But a nigga look like a hundred mil
But I drive Ferrari, fuck the motherfucking dealer
Pay ten million for a mansion, that worth more than your opinion
I got racks all in my cargo pants
Extended clip with that hollow, man, yo bitch ass
If yo bitch bad, she get fucked fast, ain’t no romance
My diamond dancing in 3D, nigga
Like the Vegas strip when you see me, nigga
Your money wrong and my money long
And I'm playing with it like P.E., nigga
Real nigga, no joke, don’t think there, nigga, no ho
I got mini Mac-10 and a 100 round drum
In the carpet up under my car
And nigga, I don’t wanna smoke your weed
Plain gas the only thing I smoke
And I gotta thank God for the niggas off Bankhead
Shorty, they taught me everything I know
Like how to whip it, cook it, cut it, deal it
Hand it to your partner, let him flood it through the city
Really, we 'bout that action, you try us and we blasting
We turnt to the max, that’s a motherfucking fact
I'm a real nigga, fuck these rappers

Really got groupies in the lobby, hooping and a-holl'ing
And I really got bazookas with the silence'
Pointed right at your medulla oblongata, ramen noodles on your collar
I maneuver like a cougar with the chopper
Connoisseur, entrepreneur, pursuing every dollar 'til I got 'em
Got a crew of niggas who will get it popping if it's popping
Y'all newer niggas ain't really popping—that's what's popping
Got a crew of bitches coming, pussy-popping—that's what's popping

Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them

[Verse 1]
Hop in Bugatti, push it to the maximum
Young Drako, nigga I’m drippin' blood just like Dracula
In the kitchen, in the trap with a spatula
Whippin' up dope, it's looking spectacular
Bitch in London fell in love with vernacular
Count a hundred fifty K, smoking dope, watching cameras
I'm sippin' codeine and smoking on cannabis
Jump on a private jet and now I'm trappin'
You might also like[Chorus]
I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended .30 and it sittin’ on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin’ them

[Verse 2]
Balenci' my feet, I put it together
Young Drako, nigga I trap any weather
He made the wrong move, you already know I'ma kill him
Slide in that Bentley, they think I'm drug dealing
Young Drako, nigga you know I’m that nigga
I pop out the cut with my finger on triggers
Flex on that nigga, I made a quarter million
Slide through the city, a matte black Bentley
Black Murci'  like Batman
Stand in the kitchen, I beat up the pack, man
Young Drako, nigga I trap with a strap, man
Pinky ring sittin' on my wrist cost a black Jag'
Nigga, we drop them bombs just like Baghdad (Boom!)
We shootin' first, nigga no we don't clap back
Walk in the VIP, broke nigga back-back
I got a hundred and fifty thousand in my backpack
Smoking on backwoods, rolling up dope, serving good crack
Serving the junkies and fucking the hoodrats
Come to your zone and you know the way I took that
Nigga fell off, ain't shoot back
Eliantte got me shining for real
Run up on Drako, get popped like a pill
Make the wrong move, boy this shit could get real
I went and dropped a ticket on my ear
Pour up a pint, I'm sippin' lean not beer
Pull up on plug, then I disappear
VVS diamond, they looking so clear
Bust down my Rollie, it's looking like burr
A hundred fifty thousand Richard Mille
Zone 1 was signing apartments and trap with the steel
I cannot stop 'til I get a billion
Stupid ass mansion with racks to the ceiling
[Chorus]
I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended .30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia

I'm over in Illi', I'm rockin' it silly
I'm rockin' Fendi and she lookin' like, ""Really?""
Benjis on Benjis while swervin' in Bentleys
We watchin' for the cops 'cause niggas be snitchin'
Got millis on millis, my niggas, you silly
We stack it, pack it, stack it up to the ceilin'
I wrap it, package, then I ship it
All of my niggas, we get it
All of my niggas, we kill it
Catch the case, acquit it
Niggas get acquitted, got money 'cause we got no limits
I'm trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
All of my niggas, we swervin' in Phantoms
My diamonds dancin' just like Tony Montana
I take a trip from Brazil to Atlanta
I come out the water, got bricks like a boulders
They comin' in, nigga, tell me your order
My niggas get money, I swerve in a foreign
Add the coupes with the paint and the spoiler
Valet park that Bugatti, I'm winnin'
My niggas stackin', they got millis on millis
I'm runnin' bands, I'm the man in my city
I'm gettin' money, niggas hatin' like really
I'm gettin' money, niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I'm gettin' milli', I got milli' on milli'
I stack it, wrap it, pack it up to the ceilin'
I'm gettin' money, niggas know that I'm killin'
A milli', a milli', I did it, I did it

We stackin' money, we got millis on millis
We swervin', ridin', and we drivin' in Bentleys
My niggas talk and yeah, my niggas get it
All of you niggas, you gotta get it (Gotta get it)
All of my niggas, we got to get it (Gotta get it)
Used to trap out the back with twenty pounds of midgets
Twenty pounds of midget, that's what I'm trappin'
I'm cappin', had to make my mama happy
I got Louis, Gucci, now they look at me funny
They say, ""Soulja, where you get all of this money?""

Soulja strapped with the automatic gun
Fuckin' on hundreds, I don't do the ones

Jumping off the roof, god damn, where's my parachute?
Pretty boy goons, all we know is money and the loot
40 on my troop, 80 drop top, I'm on the loose
Fuck the F.B.I. and fuck all the Army troops
Fighting for what, bitch? Be your own man
I be flying through the clouds with green like I'm Peter Pan
I be so damn high, man, you don't understand
I just talked to God today, I said, ""Give me another chance""
So I'm back in the hood and I'm tryna flip the bands
I done put the double cup and poured up the kickstand
Now the hoes on my dick 'cause the tats on my hands
And my hand gripping wood behind the 2012 van
Man I pulled up in the truck, and my goons duffled up
Got the bricks and the kush and the loud pack, what?
Man you know what's going down when I pull up in the drop
And everybody on me 'cause the album just dropped
Man the Juice mixtape got the hood on fire
I'mma keep hitting licks till my young ass retire
And I'm posted in the back of the coupé, I'm on fire
If a nigga think he got me, he's a goddamn liar
And I'm posted on the wall like a goddamn fly
I'm a young pretty goon, you can see it in my eye
I done hit 20 licks, and I can't tell you why
And I can't tell you where, got goons in Delaware
Knock your heads off your shoulder if you try to think I'm scared
Man I'm Soulja Boy Tell Em, bitch I tote the infrared

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

Telling all the girls, all around the world
My last name must be Robbins

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up

Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

[Chorus: Timbaland]

Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?

I hear a lot about sinners

But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch

Runnin' to the altar like a track star

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake

I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

The first step pleases the Father

But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is27Embed"

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed"

You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
[Chorus: Rihanna, Eminem, Both]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Joyner Lucas (Traducción al Español)PortuguêsItalianoFrançaisEnglishEnglishLucky You Lyrics[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
You might also like[Refrain: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
[Chorus: Eminem & Joyner Lucas]
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice802Embed"

*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersYou might also like735Embed"

[Intro: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
You might also like[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya

Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock Demigod
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off of ya
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked on the world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I O. J. the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
A double-edge sword, it cuts both ways, I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle to sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical!)—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster (Yeah!)

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M

So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang

But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note

(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" (Yah)
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah!)
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!"" (Huh?)—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)

Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Chorus 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)403Embed"

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up

'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]

Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie303Embed"

Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

[Verse 4]
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""

No time to waste, back to my place""

As life goes on
I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
You might also like[Chorus]
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
[Chorus]
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
[Outro]
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)

Rip ridinin' them poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
‘Cause pussy is pussy and, baby, your pussy for life

Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub

Move the patty to the Caddy

Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bail, they can't get me out
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggas know the dread be out

[Verse 2: Akon]
I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin'
And now they done stopped me
And I get locked up

Heading up town to re-up
Back with a couple ki's
The corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma Ryde or Die and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
When I walk by, nigga, get up
‘Cause I'm locked up, they can't get me out
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
Can't wait for the day when they let me out

[Verse 5: Akon]
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me

And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

I know they wanna come and separate us
But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wife and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you
And either way you look at it, I ain't goin' nowhere from my muffin'
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin'
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by, things are gettin' harder
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[Verse 1 : BIG]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
(you betta have your gat in hand cause man)

Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want

It’s a dirty job but somebody’s gotta do it
I see you working go and put your back into it
Baby I’mma watch… you, just keep it moving
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work

[Verse 1: Akon]
Ass up
Face down
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground
Stacked up
Waist down
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar
Asking dumb questions like “baby, do you model?”
Promising everything, hopin’ that they follow
Praying for America, I hope they down with Harry Potter
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...
Go and do your dirty work
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...

Back up
Shake down
Just give it all to me and do it right now
Shack up
Take down
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown
You’re the best that ever did it
You’re killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living?
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin'
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin'
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
More money, more problems, less rest
If it’s about a dollar later, shorty, let’s invest
Drop the top, pull the whip out like a hamstring
You on your job but I’m a boss, I keep my hands clean
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat
I’m lettin' out all of this smoke
I’m thrown' money in the air
I’m buying' bottles for my folks
And then I’m coming back for more
‘Cause you know all my favorite features
I'mma roll some of this reefer
You can call me Young Khalifa

I can't wait

[Verse 1: Akon]
I think of you
When the morning comes and the night time goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)
There is nothin' stoppin' me from lovin' you
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin' you
What's this feelin' taking over, me?
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)

Un culito así no se encuentra en eBay
Este bicho es tuyo, te lo tengo en layaway
Es más ninguna tiene brake
No soy un pitcher, pero a ti te voy a hacer el doble play
Yo sé que eres fina, pero en la cama Sasha Grey
Fumando y bebiendo Grey
Lo siento por Casper, pero J-Lo se va con Drake
Te llevo pa' New York un fin de semana
Un polvo antes de acostarte, otro por la mañana
Hay un chorro de bobos que te tienen gana'

Tengo la necesidad de saber lo que piensas
Cuando piensas en mí
En la intimidad me convence de que no me arrepienta
De las cosas que me hace a mí (mí)
Y su pelo que le llega al suelo
Una mirada que no refleja miedo
Un deseo que me tiene preso
Le quiero mentir, pero le soy sincero

Aq-Aquí dañándome la mente
He sido paciente cuando te demoras
Hace tiempo quería verte
Y hoy por suerte soy quien te devora
Ya no le importa nada, es una nena mala
Y no le quiere bajar
Y si hay humo en el ambiente
Se pone demente y no quiere parar
Me saca su instinto animal
Ese que sale cuando ya es tarde
Tiene su punto y yo se lo encontré, ieh-eh, eh-eh-eh

Y si hay humo en el ambiente
Se pone demente y no quiere parar
Me saca su instinto animal
Ese que sale cuando ya es tarde
Tiene su punto y yo se lo encontré, ieh-eh, eh-eh-eh

[Verso 2]
Si quieres, dime a ver
¿Tú estás hot? Yo también
Subiste de nivel
No le bajas de cien
Ha pasado más de una hora
Y sigue pidiendo como si empezamo' ahora
[Pre-Coro]
Ya llegué yo pa' apagarte ese fuego
Hacértelo bien para vernos de nuevo
Sé que tal vez tienes un novio nuevo
Pero estás inquieta por este veneno, uouh-uouh-uouh

Nena, tú vas sin freno
Te gusta pecar, te adueñas de lo ajeno
En mi cama se instala y amanecemos
Cómo me hablas, me desespero (me desespero, baby)

[Puente]
Tengo la necesidad de saber lo que piensas
Cuando piensas en mí
En la intimidad me convence de que no me arrepienta
De las cosas que me hace a mí (mí)
Y su pelo que le llega al suelo
Una mirada que no refleja miedo
Un deseo que me tiene preso
Le quiero mentir, pero le soy sincero

[Coro]
Aq-Aquí dañándome la mente
He sido paciente cuando te demoras
Hace tiempo quería verte
Y hoy por suerte soy quien te devora
Ya no le importa nada, es una nena mala
Y no le quiere bajar
Y si hay humo en el ambiente
Se pone demente y no quiere parar8Embed"

Pues más le daré

Que bien, que bien te queda a ti esa faldita
Ella es señora no es señorita
Sexy baila y me deja con las ganas
Como te luces cuando lo meneas
Cuanto quisiera hacerte el amor
Enséñame lo que sabes

[Verso 7: Yandel]
(¡Yandel!)
Ven vamos, que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano
Andas con Yandel, no con cualquier fulano
Lleguemos más allá
Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca
Más allá de darnos un par de copas
Tu haces que me eleve la nota
En la cama me agotas
Cuando te mueves así, bailando
Sigue rozándome así, guayando
Como te brilla la piel, sudando
Sigue así que me estas descontrolando

[Verso 8: Zion]
(Zion, baby)
Tu andas sola, también ando solo
Hoy nadie nos controla
Olvida el protocolo
Y deja la maldad salir (ouh)
Me gustas tanto que si me dejan
Bailo contigo hasta morir
(Zion, baby, ¡Ginza!)
Y yo estoy aquí sediento y loco por tenerte (Night City)
Tu boca me llama, me pide que te bese
Tu eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (Zidiri)

[Coro: J Balvin]
Si te gusta reggaeton, dale
Sigue bailando mami, no pare
Acércate a mi pantalón, dale
Vamos a pegarnos como animales
Si te gusta reggaeton, dale
Sigue bailando mami, no pare
Acércate a mi pantalón, dale
Vamos a pegarnos como animales

So the bar is where I go (Mm)

Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown

One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by

And I can't wait to go home

I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours

I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah

When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes

Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love

Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18

Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

Now, I see fire inside the mountains

Me in the middle with the one I love and

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared

Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know

To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love

You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I

Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending

I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

You put me on and said I was your favorite170Embed"

And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again

""This dorm was once a madhouse""

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Nice to meet you, where you been?

Grab your passport and my hand

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders

And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

Dame una respuesta pa' calmar mi corazón
Por que mi yal ya se marcho
Y no me dijo ni adiós
Amor espera un momento, no te vayas de mi vida
Necesito que me escuches antes de la despedida
Descuida, prometo no quitarte mucho tiempo
Solo te quiero expresar lo que en el fondo por ti siento
Remordimiento, llevo en mi adentro
Por ignorante, nunca supe valorarte
Mucho menos supe amarte
Quizás mi orgullo no me permitió buscarte
Y hoy me he dado cuenta, que fui un tonto al descuidarte
Y olvidarte es imposible, que te extrañe muy posible
La esperanza de tenerte, se convierte invisible
Por favor, no llores cuando escuches me relato
No merezco una lagrima pues no cumplí con el contrato
Juré quererte, amarte, respetarte
Darte lo mejor de mi y sobre todo no fallarte
Brindarte cariño sin ponerte condiciones
Y ya ves, no aguante la tentaciones
Y hay amores
Y hay amores que matan
Y hay amores que hieren
Tan duro que la herida nunca sana, nunca sana
Y hay amores
Y hay amores que matan
Y hay amores que hieren
Tan duro que la herida nunca sana, nunca sana

Sandra
Tu te has porta'o bien conmigo
Y tu has lucha'o y aguanta'o lo que nadie quiso
Estoy enamorado contigo como si fuera un vicio
Y te doy las gracias, porque me distes un hijo
Mama, oye, you know I love you
Con to' mi corazón I'll put no one above you
Vivir la vida sin-tigo a mi la'o, I don't want to
Y tu me has enseñado lo es mujer, chica thank you
Y ahora mami, yo te doy todo
Carro nuevo, diamantes, cadena de oro
Contigo a mi la'o ya no me siento solo

Mmh, she's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Mmh, nobody's talking
'Cause talking just turns into screaming, oh
And now as I'm yelling over her, she yelling over me

And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing (Fighting for)
Nothing (Crying for)
Nothing (Whoa, oh-oh)

Nothing, it should be nothing

But baby can we make up now

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she said leave mine alone
There ain't nothin that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Young independent, yes she work hard
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow 'em down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complainin, shorty gon' shine
She don't expect nothin from no guy
She plays aggressive but she's still shy
But you'll never know her softer side, by lookin' in her eyes
Knowin' she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne

Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh, and you gon' question me

But you should laugh, 'cause you my better half
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me (c'mon!)

And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 in-inch rim whee-eels
Look so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on
Gucci on, Lanvin, Louboutin
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I, like Mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?

Baby, I got amounts in accounts
That these other cats just don't
I don't mean to brag, so I won't
See but it don't mean nothing
Nothing without you girl

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit
All hundreds, small faces, nothin’ counterfeit
You want this ghetto D? Or that over the counter shit?
Catch you slippin’ in the kitchen on the counter shit (damn)
Oh, shit (sup), I guess I’ll pause for these bitches
Guess I’ll ball for these niggas, swear this my last three swishers
On my grown man shit, I’m ‘bout to kill these bitches

[Hook: Ne-Yo & Jeezy]
Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
Said, money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Got a diamond in the back, sunroof top
Got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off
Her mind strong, but her body so soft
Tattoo on her hip read, “only for a Boss”
She ain’t impressed with the way I ball
She said “You seen one ghost, you seen ‘em all”
Even though that thing cold
She said, “a Rolls Royce, or a Civic, daddy, I’mma roll with you”
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Shawty, where you at? Meet me at the mall
Told her, “let me buy you something”,  she replied, “naw”
She said her love won’t be bought
I don’t need to spend some no money, spend some time, that’s all
I told her, daddy don’t mind spending
I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant
She told me she don’t care for the flash
Want affection, not cash, girl, I ain’t even mad at you
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

[Hook: Ne-Yo & Jeezy]

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
What’s happening with it, baby?
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby
I will take some out the stash and buy you that new Mercedes
Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes
You call for the protectin', yeah, send me your issues
They ain’t ‘bout to be playing with her, me and these pistols
See that thirty-six for D’Usse, I’m the provider
Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider
Oh well, that’s that, back to the party
Bet you niggas anything I’m leaving here with shawty
Got a feeling that she fuckin’ with me for me
She got me feeling like I got a million on me

[Hook: Ne-Yo & Jeezy]
Baby, you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby, you got everything money just can’t buy
All the things money can’t buy, all the things money can't buy
