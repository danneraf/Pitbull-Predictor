Pop pop pop pop pop pill
Think they won’t they will and they just die in the kill
Bowling, bad one, always behind me
Room full of, billionaires that's where you'll find me

It takes for this white boy to get what you fucks feel
Flow so hard, I could scare, we ain't even supposed to be here
50,000 seats sold out now my motherfucker in that chair
Flow so hard, I need that minus all your feedback
We took over them pop charts, we might need them streets back
My checks look like typos, you're nowhere near this level
So when I say I'm like Michael, I'm the one with eight medals
And Chris say I'm doing right, if you ask me, cause I was him
I would marry Kim and Kourtney, what's happening, my hunky
What's crackin, my cracker, I heard all your new shit

In the home of the 'Canes, that's the county of Dade
Well they used to shoot straight phase now they shoot ak's
So if they kick in your door I suggest you do what they say
These are the facts of life minus them three bitches

Hey Gentlemen, haha

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got up today and my flight was late
On my way to L.A., I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades, and threw on my headphones
I was vibin' to this beat, that made me move my feet
Boy, that thang was sticky and then I heard this (Melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen, something out the usual
So Mr. Pilot, please, I think I got a hit on me
Hurry to the studio (Studio)

[Chorus: B.o.B]

Been around the world, same old songs
Now on stage after bras and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club for just singing a song
Now my passport's full, I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange, caucasians
Latino's, European's and Asian's
In Japan, they knew all my lyrics, it was amazing
They spoke Spanish
Que ma carne, ni ma carne, asi viene el sandwich
I guess it's true what they say
Music is the universal language
Its a true blessing, you know
To travel the globe
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world

Let your host be my witness
I put it on my middle name Christian
No I'm not Christian
No I'm not religious
But she's the religion
I've been missing
She my holy grail
She's my da vinci code
She's like todos los santos
All put together
Ay dios mio for sure

Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen

Here's a little story that I got to tell
About this chico named Pit everyone knows so well
Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails
These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail
I call that hustling backwards and that's real
Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell
The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin they tools

They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I'm confused
'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is its more sickening than Ebola
Until they handcuff then its over
Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders
Bust guns, sell drugs, that's what the streets showed us
But corporate America, that's what they sold usSee Pitbull LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeEmbed"

But the jig's up, the game needs a fix-up
And I don't need thе fame, I already get my dick sucked
Already have groupies, hoodies, to new v's
Rap deals to movies, coochi to gucci
No longer say ""excuse me""
'Cause ""Who's he?"" truthfully
I'm Roy at these balls, I'm the new form of sushi
A suit doesn't suit me, nice jeans lose me
There's always one bitch in the group
Look at the foogies, I was never bougie
But please introduce me by my new name

Blowing out, check it off, take em' out, check it off
Any up, check it off, now look at all the checks I scored
You don't wanna see me in the alley or the valley
'Cause I've been to both, been to 'proach
'Cause I'm known to sing for both
Also known to drink and smoke, pull a chick and use a throw
Always use a rubber coke, but use it light without a note
You know I'm a fuckin' star and if you don't
Well, now you know, I'ma take the top and it's no bitch
And that's just how it goes

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
I'm cut from the different club
Different club then Asher Roth
Different club then Rick Ross
But somehow I just mix them all
Then I started thinking more, thinking more 'bout the club
Like I ain't come to clubs at all, the last lines cross em' all
More like I'm cut from gold or this shit that Weezy sold
Oh, you say I'm cut from ice cause my flow is freezing cold
The truth always freezes
Though, i'm just trying to feed a hoe
You don't need to ask shit, I'll tell you what you need to know

Rush, Mr. Worldwide
You can catch me in Russia
At a billionaire's night
No I never rush 'em, but I get what I like
Baby, no Russian, I'ma tell you what I like

[Hook 1: Pitbull]
Girl it's on tonight
You got me tripping off them strobe lights
You know this Vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

[Verse 1: David Rush]
So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don't care
Any universe, any atmosphere
Clock say 1:12 so we're outta here
We can do it anywhere
She throwing up dubs screaming West Side
I got a Cali king you can fit just right
Pick cars depending on what's the best drive
Give you the keys, let you test drive
Top floor with the suite sound great
Looking out the window over the Tri-state
She come mad early and leave mad late
And I ain't eating at the table, don't need no plates
Her clothes in the bedroom floor
We're not even in the bedroom no more
I get a text message in the morn'
Like daddy, where you headed, do me like that for
You might also like[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: David Rush]
Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
Go upstairs, back down soon
My couch's soft, my floor too
We can take a day if you want to
Turn you on like TV, HD, 3D
I spin you around like a CD
Baby don't make it so easy
She boiling like water with tea in the kettle
She wrecking my place like the Tasmanian devil
I'm giving the base, she giving the treble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun's up
Or we can get it in when the sun's down
Or maybe we can meet halfway
Either way, baby girl I'ma put it down

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: Pitbull (David Rush)]
Girl it's on tonight
You got me tripping off them strobe lights
You know this Vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
(yeah, let's show 'em tonight)
And we can go from the bed to the floor (yeah)
From the window to the wall (let's go)
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor

I'm like a quarterback, I got options
But I play the point in school
Broke ankles, more than a few
Broke hearts, yeah that too
Twenty years later, same movie, same script
Same player, more chips
More women, more haters
Different toilet, same shh...
Why get caught up in emotions?
Why go through the same motions?
In a sick way she loves to see me mad
It gets her wetter than the ocean
She's a good girl gone bad
But bad girls don't like good guys
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
That's what I though, ha let's ride

Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said

Then they fall in love and make everything seem what it's not

Welcome to the world of entertainment

They want a man that's duck in the Raymond's

That's what hip-hop look like right now, recession, ha-ha
Everybody talkin' 'bout they the best rapper
Y'all ain't gotta ask that no more
Don't worry 'bout it, it ain't me
I ain't gon' take y'all spot, not yet, ha-ha

[Verse]
Pit don't beef with rappers or throw his money in the air
I just fight companies, take bankrupt like, ""Yeah""
I don't think y'all understand what I'm gon' do this year
So y'all better listen here like, ""Yeah"", huh
Everybody that raps [?], sold crack
Had spots, has traps, got gas, they this, they that
They thugs, they bust, they slugs
They spit thеy clips, they pimp they bitch
They flip thеy bricks, they hit they licks
But most of these rappers are constipated
Yeah, you guessed it, they full of shit (Whoo)
I'm back and y'all boys don't do this (Nope)
I been raised by chicos and [?] (Yah)
This is so far from a movie
To tell you the truth, you messing with goonies (Whoo)
Single [?] dinero by lunes (Nope)
And meet them boys with the [?] (Nope)
[?] moved to Miami, [?] and dropped them off in the boonies (Whoo)
I know it may sound harsh
But walk into the streets where them thangs'll bang, boom, boom, spark
All my life I've had a front-row seat
If I ain't do it, I saw it

They're dying to kill
And living to die
Snub nose, headshots
If you touch anything that's mine
Respect, Loyalty
Dan la vida para la familia
They live for the honor
They'll kill for the honor
They'll die for the honor
Wise guys take life from the box
Look judge in the eyes
Put they hand on the bible
And lie to you, only to leave something to the coroner

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
From the law, from the feds
Fuck cops, pop pop
Catch you at your favorite spot
Well dressed little men but dangerous
Go-getters, hustlers, gangsters
Everything organized
And if they hit us its a prize
One to the heart and two to the brain
Looks like he lost his mind, let's ride
There's rules and codes
You don't break them for no one
Unless you're a fool like that fucking prick

Three piece suit with a piece by the waistline
Just in case a motherfucker wanna take mine
Imma get mine, get theirs, get yours
Cock back, click-clack, gimme that fat line
Mob royalty, walk out that court not guilty, filthy
But yet so fresh, so clean
So gentleman, so mean
So loved, so hated
Yeah I killed, yeah I extorted, yeah I robbed
But I'm the God of the mob, fuck it I made it
From nothing to something, scum to thugs
Thug to gangster, gangster to mobs
To no pot to piss in the pasta and lobster
Bitch I'm a rockstar
The king from Queens
That killed and died for his dreams
The rotten apple from the Big Apple
The realest gangster you've ever seen

They got two ears, and they still don't listen
You speak something clear, and they still don't listen
They act like they here but they still don't listen
And you do some real shit
And then they start switchin'
And then they start bitchin'

Algo me pasa cuando te veo
Tú llegas y de lejos te olfateo
Que no me quiere, que lo supere
Que nunca me desespere

Pero hay que mirarla cuando se mueve

Me paso disimulando
Cuando alentando
Pero noche sigo llorando
Dime, baby, hasta cuándo
Yo me estoy desesperando

I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK (OK)
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all

Baby
I’m far from an angel
And you’re my angel, ain’t ya
I love your angel ass
I hate to see my angel cry
But sometimes I’m foolish
Do things that break your heart
Play with your mind and emotions
I know I’m a work of art
Sometimes I feel lonely and even helpless
But then I look in the mirror and see I’m just being selfish
I wanna protect you
I wanna love you
You’re my angel baby
There’s nothing above you

And lightning don't strike the same place twice

True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I thought we'd be forever and always
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right, but it was OK
I do somethin' stupid and you’d still stay with me
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone and

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
We were so good together
How come we could not weather
This storm and just do better
Why did we say goodbye?
[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Mariah Carey)]
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
(C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?)
(Bring it back and we gon' make it right)
(I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive)

Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through

[Intro: Yandel]
¡Yandel!

[Pre-Coro: Yandel & Pitbull]
Me encanta su cuerpo (Oh-oh-oh; Mr.Worldwide)
La forma en que lo hace (Oh-oh-oh; Jaja)
Para ella no hay liga (Jajajajaja; you know It's not a lie)
Es una asesina (When they say that)
Y yo que ando suelto (¡Yandel!; women make the world go round)
Velando que ella hace (Oh-oh-oh; Jajaja)
A ver si se anima (It's just the truth)
A terminar como debe ser (So just listen; pah)

[Coro: Yandel]
Yeah, yoh (Yeah, yoh)
Nos encontramos una noche de pasión (Noche de pasión)
Lo que no debió pasar, me sucedió (Heh-heh; me sucedió)
Me hipnotizó y en sus brazos me hizo ilusión
Yo que tuve el presentimiento (¡Suelta!)

[Post-Coro: Yandel]
Me dejé llevar por su actitud
Y empecé a pensar: ""Aquí vamos a terminar""
No podré luchar con su magnitud (Hah)
Y aunque pensé mal, tuve que aceptar (EAR; Ya-Ya-Ya-Yandel)

Las latinas son las más ricas, más calientes

Asesina (Heh)
Mata hombres (Heh)
Te conozco, bacalao' aunque vengas disfraza'
Descarao' y fresco, sí es la verdad

Yo soy diablito, yo no soy el ángel (¿Cómo?)
Pónmelo ahí, que te lo voy a romper (¿Cómo?)

Que los besos más humildes
Le borraron de la piel el Chanel (Yandel)
Yo no reclamo na', eso quedó en el ayer (Chacal)
Agradecerle a estos ojos que la vieron llorar una vez (DJ Chino)
Y ya tú ves (Jaja)
Quizás se le olvidó (Mamita, hah)
Decir que me quería esa tarde tan fría de invierno
(Sigue comiendo con los ojos)
Por prestarle atención a la ropa, a la cara y el cuerpo
(Que vas a morir por la boca)
Quizás se le olvidó (Jajaja)

Ay, mi Dios (Eh)
Quizás perdí en la batalla porque el que merece no pide
Que me amara y quisiera de la forma en que yo lo hice
Es que amar con habilidad nunca ha sido posible (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yo no me niego al amor, no me niego a nada que me dé pasión

Okay, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents

Haters in the club (back up!)
Gold Diggers (back up!)
Broke niggas (back up!)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up!)

[Verse 1]
I'm in the cut in the club scopin' the scene
Cup half way full smokin' the green
She got her hand on my nuts—what does that mean?
Pointed at her freind and she said they'll tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
It's like I'm dreamin' when I come through
I always find somethin' to run through
Speak into the mic, mami, mic check one two
Drunk in the club off the chain
But who gives as fuck? That's why I came
So pour it up and get down
Y'all have no choice but to listen to Pit now

[Chorus]
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up!)
It don't involve money then (back up!)
Dawg, get from me and (back up!)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up!)
Haters in the club (back up!)

Everybody knows Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club, DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is, ""Does he got cash?""
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them Eastside Boys smoke out
Roll another one, no doubt
Get a couple hoes, roll out
Beef, you dont want none to go down
Dum diddy dum dum, my time's now
The city I'm from is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run, your crew run run
It's next to come

[Chorus]
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up!)
It don't involve money then (back up!)
Dawg, get from me and (back up!)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up!)
Haters in the club (back up!)
Gold diggers (back up!)
Broke niggas (back up!)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up!)

[Verse 3]
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinnin' like some sprewells
Skip the details, it's the vodka
Bottom line that's testin' my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars, all that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin' for, keep lookin' ho
'Cause you got the wrong one bitch, I'll let you know
Mami's like, ""Damn, that Cuban's shot out!""
Bitch I came to the club to wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch and back up

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up!)

And when I see women, it's ménages they offer
And you know that I’m all for

Now you know you got them women that are sexy
And you got those women that, you know, they're freaky
Got those women that are pretty
Some that are fine
And when you put all that together
That's when you got you a bad girl
Bad girl, mala mala, si no te veo hoy yo te veo mañana (¿cómo?)
Bad girl, mala mala, coje los hombres y lo deja cambiada (dale)
Bad girl, hola hola, si no te cojo hoy yo te cojo mañana (¿cómo?)

But like Jay say ""How sick am I? I wish you health"" fosho
But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it
It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me

I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me
I thank Miami for the way you raised me

But you know that they bad, let's ride

Yo vedo que te gusta el party
I see that you like to ignite it
I see that you like to do the things
That you shouldn't do
Go, shawty
Baby, in your ass I read it

But you can't deletе it when I eat it, hmm

Your lips, they could be a work of art
I love the way you're put together, together

[Intro: Pitbull]
From Miami to South Korea, hahaha
MONSTA and Mr. Worldwide, let's ride

[Chorus]
No matter where you are tonight
I'ma fly 'round the whole world to find you
I know you could be that, down to ride
You know I would leave oceans behind you
Set in the jet trail, with a cloud of smoke
Spell your name out, for the cosmos
No matter where you are tonight
I'ma make sure I end up beside you

[Verse 1]
I got a passport, I just need a place, I'm down
Gonna be there when you wake up in the middle of the night
I just wanna be the one you call on
Be the body pillow that you sleep on
I can feel your aura calling me on
This whole night going back too slow
So tell me how to reach ya, get my body beneath ya
Send me your location, so I can come and see ya
Know I'm out of space between (Ooh)
Can't take it out my mind, yeah
You are where I'm supposed to be

You have to have vision to understand love is blind, talk to ‘em Ty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 1]
Got a room with a mirror on the roof
Down in the keys keys keys
And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee
That you will always look better on me
I handle my business in the boardroom and the bedroom
My name ain't max but I always got headroom
G-g- get it, g-g- g-g- get it
Went from selling perico and reefer
To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah
I shut down Spain
And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza
I'm a beast bro
I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits
With the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror
And see you always look better on me

I live for the future, you live in the past
Found somebody else, I hope that it lasts
But you know that I know that we know that you'll be thinking bout me
But you know that I know that we know that you look, that you look better on me
I ain't here to sell ya, I'm here to tell ya, all I've ever done is learn from my failures
So god bless mami, cause God knows I wish you the best mami, that's right

Album coming soon, expect the unexpected

(We got) Cold boy
(Walking through the club like our shit don't stops)
(We got) Rick Ross
(We got) P.O.I
(We got) E-Class
(We got) Diaz Brothers, whoooo!

[Verse 1: P.O.I]
Remember back in the days we used to smoke puffs
Ice or alligators, shurkled smuffs
Louis Vuitton, I used to rock it like the dons
Gucci with the things not painted on
Now the days done gone, and shit done changed
I went from a bum coat to a 6 rain
[?] Bacardi razz rains, light rate chains, prints is cut meng
Cheddar like [Bell, Peter?] up in the club
VIP with the black heater, thug bronze, smoking on blue sticky
They see me balling in this game and they wanna hit me, called nonsense
Let's go, [?] ball till I fall, that's my motto, in LA, NY, even in 4's
Sitting on tractor rims, with mexicans
Took packs again, want sex again
[With a dime?] it was told with me
By that boy AKA the P.O.I

Pit's got 'em looking out like the Tri-State Snipers, so watch out! (watch out)
When I was young, I used to drop tops and spin them
Now I'm predicted to drop tops on drops, sitting on spinners (hahaha)
And I'm not gonna stop 'til my pockets look beat up, filled up with knots
But words are spit, I'm worth more than any verse I spit, I hustle rap, I serve y'all quick
In school I never had a 4.O, but my Range Rovers' gonna' read 4.6
Teachers always told me I was a smart kid, so it's only right I push smart whips
So when I pull up pushing, something, sitting on rims older than me (older than me)
Hopping out with [Courtney?] and Rick Ross, Diaz and DB (DB)
Y'all can witness the come up, from a poor boy to a rich boy
It ain't my fault, y'all eat where where ya shit boy
Who's that cuban tha's gonna' have a big bank, uh?, that's pit boy!

Collecting more chips than ladies at sex parties
Me? I, be with P.O.I, till' I'm calm
Resting in the Bronx with Chron stones to V double
Look around where you stay at, cause it's like trouble
Who watch us? My man Ricky Ross, six inch steel
Gonna toil for those who gon' test the calicoe wrist
Can't forget E-Class, sniper like, even with perif
We'll view your little sight
With so much ice, we turn night into day
We too fly, at the front of The Source Awards (Redeye)

Sometimes I Fell Like I'm Loosing It
My Life Is Upside Down
A Gift And A Curse That's My Life Now
There Is No Looking Or Turning Back
I Used To Watch Coke Turn To Crack
That's What Made Me Turn To Rap
I Fell Like Keanu Reeves In The Movie Devils Advocate
Confused But Blessed With Extravagance
I Thank God For All The Opportunities
Given The Opportunity Dem Boys Would Put Two In Me
We Live In The Land Of The Free, Hustlers And Thieves
I Made Money Now I Got Uncle Sam Hustling
Me For A Quarter Of What I Make
Hand A Quarter Sentence To A Fake
And Watch Them Turn State (That's Right)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Most Of These Fools Are Characters
Men With No Character Welcome To America
Where We Fight For Freedom
If Ain't About Oil Than We Don't Need Them
Ain't That The Truth?

I'm Convinced There Ain't No Hope Here
In The Past Four Years Of My Lifetime I Witness Leaders Sacrifice Freedom Just To Get This Pipeline
Guess I'm Chosen At The Right Time Mama Stress
Facing The Table And She's Snorting Up White Line
Blood Is Thicker Than Water
In A Few Cases Your Daughter Can Have Touched For The Money That In Dem Suit Case
Tighten My Shoelaces The Fugitive Running
In Fear Of A Criminal Past 'cause Dem Folks Is Coming
I've Been Wrongfully Judged Being From This Environment

Voicing My Set 'cause A Spray Quick

I've been processed, packaged, delivered in bricks
I've been cut, cooked, chopped, and whipped
I've been called all types of names (heh)
Like perico, yeyo, snow, blow, and cane
I'm the reason that the Cubans took over Miami
I'm the reason they extorted Escobar by extraditing his family
I'm protected by killers
I'm handles by dealers
Well-connected with greed
I'm all white but I produce green
They'll kick in your door, like Bruce Lee
Just to have an intimate love affair with me
I corrupt governments. Yeah, that's me (ha ha ha)
I built the streets, listen closely
Now, it's cool to be a snitch, it's cool to go to jail
It's cool to get caught. Damn, where did I fail?
When I was in the streets heavy they had codes and rules
Now it's just steady foes and fools
That's why they get found stiff like frozen food
Take a sniff and let me remind you (Whoo!)

[Chorus]
Sniff (co-), snort, (-caine)
Deal (cow-), extort (-boys)
Will (will), kill (kill)

3, 2, 1

[Hook 1: Akon]
Now put your hands in the air, shake your body down slow
Go on and bring it, bring it back like you never did it before
Keep your hands in the air while you drop it down low
Let me see you work it out like a stripper on a pole

[Bridge: DJ Felli Fel]
Okay..
If you came to party tonight I need y'all to get y'all drinks in the air
Get your Cîroc bottles in the air
And if you see a sexy lady right now;
Put your fucking hands up!

[Hook 2: Akon]
Your body lookin' amazing when you're dancing like that
Girl, get up on the stage and go ahead and do your thang
Sexy beautiful lady, won't you bring it right back?
Go head and pull a 180, you're my boomerang

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Mommy got a boom bang, bing bang, ding dang
No diggity, no doubt, I’ma hit that
That thing so fat, looks like she got a
Oompa Loompa in her pants, now give me that
I don’t beat around the bush like Kim K
But I discipline your ass, call me sensei
I don’t care what them say
Cause that little chick on Mr. Worldwide – Pen pay
From M.I.A. to L.A. to P.A., leavin' bread like CJ
CJ meeting Pam in the scene on Baywatch
I stay high, what she talk about?
I don't pimp in the parking lot
I got your girl in the bathroom acking a monkey
While I play with her bam boom
Then I throw her back like a boomerang, you buffoon
You might also like[Hook 2]

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Felli! I see ya
You know I had to get on this!
Let's go!

That uh, Rose I pour it, shorty
I'm where she throw it
It's a sight to see her shake her ass (Drop it low)
Fresh to death, I'm polo and we are
In the middle of the floor
And completely gone
ATL, HAM you know it-know it
Niggas don't dance no more, they actin'
And I can understand it with all the back-end
And all these shawties throwing at the party
I'm like, ""Nigga, you trippin'""
You better act like you know
You better grab you somethin', take your ass to the floor
Cause it's clear, I'm here and I ain't leaving up out this bitch 'till it's time to go

Amanda, you know I got your back
It's Mr. 305, checkin' in on the remix {I got them candy kisses on my mind}
Heh heh heh
For all the women out there that wonder
If Pit is
Really a freak or not
Just know this, baby (Ha ha ha)
I got them candy kisses
Ha ha ha

[Rap Verse: Pitbull]
Mama want them
Candy kisses, right?
And that's what I give her, right?
When I kiss her below the liver, she quivers
And I gotta deliver
Like the mailman, I'm talkin'
Carl Malone from John Stock
And I promise
Once I start, then I won't stop
Got her in a
Backseat, all the soft talk
Gettin' hot
Gettin' wet, and she knows what she gettin' next
Ya tu sabes que con migo es
Completamente
Diferente when we havin' sex
Yo te doy el
Caramelo bueno que huepe loca
En la calle
Mujer en la cama, eres [{*puta*}]
And that's what I
Love about ya
We'll be together, it's all about ya
I remember when I hollered at ya
For the first time
Swear to God
Couldn't get you off my mind

That is of course
If you want some of this Candyman
Just stand in front of the mirror
Say ""Candyman"" three times

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Baby, just call me (Candyman)
You know they call me (Candyman)
That's right they call me (Candyman)
Every city, every state, every country, mami I'm known as (Candyman)
Baby just call me (Candyman)
When ya want some of this (Candyman)
Say name in the mirror three times baby, just call me

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I don't think that you're ready for the bang bang
When I bump in the guts
I be tearin' it up doin' my thang thang
Hey, hey, hey little mama
I'd love to see that ass In Victoria's Secret pajamas
Yes, yes, yes
I'm a freak freak that eats, eats pussy like Jeffrey Dahmer
Ay mi madre, just gimme a night and I promise I'll change ya life
But remember, baby girl that you're not my wife
Other then that I don't give a fuck, let's keep in touch

[Verse 2: Twista]
I'm gonna take it to masses when I get pulled
I'ma pop the plastic on the clip board
Give some of that til I get fooled
It's the neo-politan master for the Pitbull
Better known as Twista, it's the lister
Women really wanna hear that 'cause I like that
I leave a generator in the back of the bass
Now could you pass that, baby, I wanna bite that
Twista be coming to your office in a tube
Wanna fuck you on the desk like a handyman
I do anything for you that you Candyman
Lick you all up in your body, call me Candyman
If you was a gangsta from Chi or Cabrini Green
Gotta represent 'em when I be wrecking that pussy
Plus, I'm representing different flavors and all the bitches
I be licking the sticker when I take the hoodie off

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Now I'm not saying that I turned every woman
That I'm out with, 'cause then I'd be lying
But God knows I'd be trying
It's sort of like golf when I'm swinging this iron
But even Tiger Woods has his off days
And me, I've had my soft days
That's why that thing called foreplay, that there's my forte
Cause baby it don't matter what you look like
But if you don't talk dirty and get nasty
We might as well stop and call it a night
Why waste time, that's right, but on the other hand
If you got an open mind and you willing
We can get down to the needy, greedy
Lick pussy, ass and titties

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Baby, just call me (Candyman)
You know they call me (Candyman)
That's right they call me (Candyman)

I know, I said I should stay in my bed

It's Mr. Throw-a-Bone and Pain, y'all know the name
Didn't go to private school, but now it's private planes
And we stay around the world in hotels under private names
Bartender, give me a Voli-water-lime
Put your drinks in the air, it's Voli time
Everybody rap about vodka
Only difference is this low-cal, and Voli's mine
I don't mean to brag, so don't think wrong
As a matter-fact, Pain, let's get our drink on
Mama over there named Judy
And she got a tutti-frutti juicy booty you can put a drink on
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Know what that means? They ain't drinking
These type of things happen all the time
Y'all better get yours, 'cause I'm gon' get mine

Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
Mr. W.W., haha!
I told you once (Can't Have)
I tell you twice (Can't Have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
Til you get to the other side, haha

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have
Can't have
Can't have
Ohhhhhh!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I see Central Park from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
About the crazy things we used to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different cultures
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shined the shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants
[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side

Big dog Pitbull, It's Mr. 305 checking in
Hey you know we had having uh
Some drama with the label
Over there at TVT, Mr. Steve Gottlieb
But tell 'em like this: clear this
No matter what you do you can't stop me

We got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em

[Verse 1]
We got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Tell Steve, I don't care, sue me motherfucker
305 till the death man
You sold your soul to the devil
Now you owe your whole ass off to Def Jam
This no under the table the thing, oh no
Ask your whole damn label if they feel the same, for sure
White man, black male
What I mean to say is white man
Loves the black man for them record sales
I'm a slave to the game, I had to fight to get paid
But thanks Steve, I'm learning something new every day
I brought you Pretty Ricky, Daddy Yankee, Jim Jonsin
Wouldn't sign them 'cause I wouldn't let you extort them
Lil Jon got my back, Ying Yang got my back
DJ Khaled got my back, Mr. Collipark got my back
You can own what I rap
But you can't control what I say, fuck TVT

Can’t you tell that i came from the dope game?

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
My father was heavy in the dope game
I'm talking early 80s
You know them coke days
At a tender age I was breastfed cocaine
That was my first intro to the dope game
Grew up watching Tony Montanas in real life
It's only right I wanted to be Tony in real life
At 14 I started selling weed, moved on to acid, LSD
My mom found a stash and flushed, the whole thing
Oh shit, now its time for a plan B
Caught my first 8-Ball at 120
Broke it drown and flipped it for 3
Did it a couple times, flipped OZs
From there, I was on my way keys
Got saved by the rap game, and that was it for me
Man I came from the dope game

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Yeah, dope game raised me
I’ve been getting money since the 80s
While my hoes tryna tame me
I was making sure some fool paid me
While rap guys tell fiction
I’m in the courtroom beating the conviction’
I play hard in Detroit like a piston (what else?)
My weed bags be chunky, call it Lipton
Lipton, homie what it be like
Sit the pot in the ice so it freeze right
Take the cookie out, put it on the bounty
I'm from the go-game, homie kings county (what else?)
Master criminal activity
Flatness squeeze, clack, clack willingly
Credit card scams, i bust checks on ’em
Anything to get green like the jets on ’em
You might also like[Verse 3: Hot Rod]
I swing bars like dope, blow
My 16s be the Os, my flow be the coke
Money ain’t green even though i got soap
The trap house looking like a ski slope (damn)
Money, that is my wife
Put a ring on my wallet and guard it with my life (my life)
You see the coup, the products in the muffler
Call me Larry Flynt, jack I'm a hustler (ha ha ha ha)
When it comes to this shit I'm a monster (what?)
And when it comes to this shit you win an Oscar (an Oscar)
Welch ass nigga you’s a Simp (Samp)
Me, I’m a pimp, leg’s fine but I limp
Got cane, candy red rain (what?)
Jay got Beyonce, I settle for Celine (yeah)
Cash heavy gotta move it with a crane (crane)
My bread crazy, bank account insane (yeah)

[Chorus: Murphy Lee]
Can’t you tell that i came from the dope game?

[Verse 4: Trazz]
When Trazz on the track it’s certified crack
Baggie hit the streets you can watch your money stack
Rap’s like the crack game, now I’m in a trap
Pay me 30 stacks, see your money double back, uh
My 16's come out doper than codeine (what?)
One verse from Trazz, get you bigger than protein (yeah)
Music b-boy, beats i destroy
Flip my style and watch the pockets key lord
Whether rap or crack all the same (same)
Heroin flow, got it running through my veins
Stay in my post while they fiend for a dose
And see my product travel all the way down the coast
Oooh, It’s like a virus, they got to try this
I love the green you’d swear I was Irish
I write my bars and sell them by the jars (jars)
The fiends here can’t get enough, like El DeBarge, know why?
[Chorus: Murphy Lee]
Can’t you tell that i came from the dope game?

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
Now you can A-town stomp or you can rock away
But when I was hustling I never gave a rock away
They say St. Louis raised me, certified 80s baby
Been through a lot of shit for months, like a pregnant lady
All I remember is crip and blood differences
Some niggas made it out but others we remember them
But on the better note know we all getting money now
My past was no joke but everything funny now
I’m talking stress-free Bentley's, Nestle's
Mr. What-the-hook-gone-be (Murphy lee!) that’s me
Spending all money, sometimes on your honey
Taking turns for me, she making that to-go money
I’m glad I’m smart enough not to do a lot of stuff
Never had to prove that the young dude was hard enough
Even though I came from the city where I came from
Moves made all around me but I ain’t saying nothing

[Verse 6: Jay Rock]
Can’t you tell that I came from the dope game
150 grams of soda mixed with cocaine
The iron chef, I whip it up in hell’s kitchen (tell ’em)
Shit it’s all in the wrist, boy I’m nice with it
Get a coffee pot hot, drop some ice in it
Take it out, chop it down, put a price with it
Frank Lucas had the blue magic
I’m like Freeway Rick, I move traffic
I’m a hustler baby, fiends tryin’ talk me down
I’m like fuck you, pay me
Funds got bigger, guns got bigger
The block got dry then we robbing them dealers
Connect come through, then we at it again
Cooking pies, do or die, but we at it to win
Got goons that’ll bust, tell ’em where and when
Wide city dope boy, I got money to spend
Motherfucker!

No hables si no puedes, que aquí lo tengo
Tú vienes primero, entonces yo me vengo
Yo trabajo [?] veinticuatro hora' al dia, de lune' a domingo
Mami never thought she'd like women 'til she met me
Funny thing is I ain't need change or a Bentley
To get her involved with a full-blown ménage
Now she's like, ""I don't give a fuck"" like Lil Jon
[Chorus: Urban Mystic & Woman]
Can I get it? You can get it
Can I get it? You can get it
Do you think that you handle it?
I know that I can handle it (Yeah)
Let me see you take that (Uh)
I'ma show you how I take that, uh
Do you think that you handle it?
I know that I can handle it (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Urban Mystic]
You got my temperature high, I'm on standby waitin' to come
Now puck up, let me kiss you while talkin' a picture
Seen me up in the magazines, wantin' to fuck
Now all bitch wanna fuck when a nigga come up
But that's a'ight, boo, 'cause that's what I want you to do
Now get me head in the waterbed elegantly
And arch ya back while ya doin' me, fluently
All on the sofa in the middle of Oprah
Take time to recline and relax yo'self
But wait a minute, get the Magnum off the bookshelf
And I could do e'rything in a matter of seconds
Baby girl, this a fuck song, check the record
Yeah, e'rything in a matter of seconds
It's a fuck song, check the record, know that
[Chorus: Urban Mystic & Woman]
Can I get it? You can get it
Can I get it? You can get it

So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'd sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers
I try to do good, even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart
But my blood's filled with demons, I'm fighting myself, hah
Believe me, I'm far from lingering, far from ready
If you knew where I come from, knew what I've been through
You'd think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids, a father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they'll X you like Malcolm
Then you wonder how come
I can move in a room full of wolves so swift, so smooth
Thank you, Mom, for making me a man
Let a motherfucker knock down my castle out of sand

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe (To believe) in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand

(Woo!)
I lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking for the keys, but they won't find 'em
I come from struggle, I'm a fighter, must she be reminded?
My mother's past has her trapped, has her blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future
Mom, I love you, I salute ya
And no matter what happens, just know you're the reason that I'm rappin'

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe (To believe) in the castle made of sand

And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
Look
I'm from the home of the spinners, the winners, the Big Apple
Came down to South Beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustlin' and every day you hassle
Doin' what you can and I'm doin' what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Pit hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother, took three and went to jail
I'm sending all the pictures of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter, said, ""I knew you'd never fail""
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

I'm an underdog but want all of the above
Rock and roll is a rocky road

Schemin, Triple beamin, double teamin bitches with my homies
I got no blame its just some bitches understand my story
And anger problems, my brother, Uly won't hear before me
Rap had me, wanting to be a dope boy
Now I rap, I stay away from that dope, boy
It's destiny, I was breast fed that coke boy
And when you seem them chicos better call them folks boy
I'm putting ya'll on the game
I'm hearing raps about coke and crack (crack?)
To be honest they all sound the same

Ella no 'tá enamora' de mí (Don Miguelo; yo tampoco; no, no)
Pero le gusta como yo le doy
(Mr. Worldwide; como te muerde' los labio', sexy)
Yo la pongo a volar cuando yo le doy besos
Pero no 'tá enamora de mí
Ella solamente quiere pasa' un momento lunático
She said she's not in love with me, no, no
But she loves how I give it to her, yes, yes, sexy
And I blow her mind, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Everytime that I kiss her
But she said she's not in love with me

[Post-Coro: Pitbull]
Yeah, all right
Ella siempre me llama a las tres de la mañana
Dice que soy su pana, el que le quita las gana' (Jajaja)
Y si ella supiera que me llama su hermana
Porque también soy su pana, el que le quita las gana' (¡Hu-wuh!)

[Verso 1: Pitbull, Don Miguelo]
Who the hell is this?
Texting me at 3:46, it must be a trick
And if she texting me at this time
She's looking for a Richard or should I say dick
Mami, yo te doy pao-pao
Ella dice que yo soy mal habla'o
No, mamita, yo no soy mal habla'o
Es que yo te hablo directo de Miami al Cibao
So, deja el papelazo para los turista' y los payaso'
Háblame claro, que tú sabes bien que te gusta lo malo, dale palo

Hello gorgeous, let's check out how you look today
Short and stubby, and, my gosh, look how much you weigh
You're pinkish red, got this thing on your head, and woah
Girl, you couldn't look better
Shake the sleep off and kick into the morning drill
It's another awesome day here in Uglyville
Grab your shoes, time to spread the good news, woah
Things just couldn't be better

[Pre-Chorus]
Call it hope or faith, whatever
I just know in my heart, it's the day I've waited forever

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a scrambled sun in a tangled sky
And the moon couldn't be any brighter
And as the slam big city goes rocketing by
Oh, my head couldn't feel any lighter
It's like a funhouse ride, the kind you just can't miss
Call it crazy, and yet, is there anything better than this?
Life just couldn't be better than this

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Wanda Skyes, Unknown TBA]
Nevermind that, I'll tell you what the day'll bring
First a shindig, then a bash, then more partying
Top it all with a rave, then a ball (oh, woah-oh)
Yeah, you know it couldn't be better
Morning Loxy, got something new you wanna try?
It's a brownie cupcake fudge berry ice cream pie
Just one bite, who these kids? Am I right? Babo
It just couldn't taste better

And soon, you-know-what is coming
But until it arrives, might as well keep the party humming, yeehaw

[Chorus]
Yes, it's a square peg life in a round hole town
But the folks couldn't be any sweeter (Sweeter)
It may be upside backwards and wrong side down
But it just couldn't feel more completer

[Bridge]
And there's so much to do
And it's all such bliss
There's no reason to fret
What could ever be better than this?
No, it couldn't get better than

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Stop the press, ugly dog is here
Story of the day, of the month, of the year
Here's a little scoop on the way down low
Check-check-check out the flow
The cats are rapping, lobster snapping
But only the dog makes the party happen
So put in your paper, seal it with a kiss
It couldn't bet better than this
[Chorus]
Another madhouse night in a crazy quilt world
And our hearts couldn't soar any higher
We've got our freak flags flying, completely unfurled
And we just couldn't be more fire
And life's a nonstop blast, it's utter awesomeness
Yeah, it's crazy, you bet, but it couldn't get better than this
It's crazy, you bet, it could never get better than this
Could never be better than this
Could it be better than this?

[Outro: Kelly Clarkson]
Guess another sun has set
And another moon has smiled
I'm still just one more doll
Still waiting for her child
I'm sure it's gonna happen
Just like the story says
There's a new day 'round the corner
And it just might be the day2Embed"

Are you dancin' on the dance floor or drinkin' by the bar?
Tonight, we do it big and shine like stars

This is for all the women
That have been stripped of their innocence
(She was daddy's little girl)
But no matter what, They kept their head up
And this is my way of saying thank you
(All alone in the world)

[Chorus: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself 'cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

[Verse 1: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
I was raised by women, a woman made me a man
It's just too bad that a man took her innocence
And God knows that I, I would finish him
Diminish him, end up killin' him
Blame it on the ignorance; that's where her childhood went
New country, new language, that's how seven years were spent
Time; you can't buy it, and some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads, just know Mom, that I'm here
Cuban Peter Pan, the rebelution was crazy
I wanna thank you Mom, for the way you raised me
All your life, you wanted only one thing
And that was to say (She was daddy's little girl)

Took care of me, just like a mother
Till you got pregnant, then you was off to Georgia
It was tough how we, how we were brought up
Tougher for you, 'cause you had no father
Now I understand, now that I'm a man
How much a woman needs someone to call dad
You cut through the pain, you walked through the rain
The game ain't playin' you, baby, you play the game
Now you're in search of that father figure
And if you find him, he denies you
Jenny, fuck that nigga
Karma's a bitch, even though I know she wish
(She was daddy's little girl)
[Chorus: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]

[Outro: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
This is for all the women that stayed strong
And beat all the odds (She was daddy's little girl)
The ones that have been raped, the ones that grew up fatherless
(All alone in the world)
But still found a way to raise their kids
To do the right thing (She was daddy's little girl)

Hah, bienvenidos a la cripta

Whippin' this on casa campo
Yo soy el diablo, Romeo el santo
Mister 305, Mister Worldwide
All my business partners
They call me Armando (Armando)
Vamos pa' Caleta, es la grasa
Bailando, gozando, acabando
Building schools around the world
Then if you got a question, ask Fernando

If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back because I'm playin fo' keeps
Go ahead keep playin with me and watch how I hit 'em in the head once again
For those who didn't believe in the kid y'all might as well be dead
Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all
I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap and I'm outrunnin y'all
When I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out! Whooo)

Pitbull's that underrated underdog killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement

Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man
But I don't plan it man because I do what I wanna do
Move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
I'mma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed they'll spray about three
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes

Patience is a first, and I been patiently waitin'
When I sign, it'll be anticipated
Like the Lakers with Malone and Gary Payton
Pitbull spits fire like I married Saitin
Anybody wanna try it? then Tez go ahead dog
Confess, get it off your chest
Get put in a perminant sloop
You're gettin' in the way of me and these checks
This is the future, they don't throw blows no more
These boys will shoot ya
And they gats that'll smoke you bigger than Whitney Houston
I'm not your regular rapper this is somethin' y'all not used to
Yeah, I look like a cracker but I'll crack ya man it's crucial
So y'all better think twice next time, that's if there is a next time

Pitbull
Let's take it back to the old school

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm on the dance floor, you already know
Getting loose (Yeah boy, that's for sure)
All that I say about Pit, that chico fine
Boy, he off the riff
No lie, from the home of the freaks
Home of the donks, Home of the chunky kong
What you want?
Home of the drastic hoes
Home of the dancing (Dade-County)
I'mma take it to the old school
We have booty-shaking behinds thinking it was so cool
Uncle Al, rest in peace
Crazy Legs, 2 Live Crew
What they do?
Now it's like Dеja Vu
Cause I'm doing the same thing thеy was doing in '92
We the first one that had to take it off
Everyday's her birthday, I'mma cake it off

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit
I go outside and pick the ride I'm gon' go out with
But right befo' I hit the streets
I gotta put on my dancin shoes in the mirror

In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park
I'm here to play with that little bitty thing
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these little players, acting like they can hate
But they can not
Can't, won't, don't, never will, be real

Hey Ms. Perry
Looking sexy with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic, I'm maverick, top gun

Just know one thing, I'm amazing

Kid Cudi, I love this record dawg so I had to spit somethin' on it right quick
Cyph[?], You know what it is, back dat up
Mr. 305 know let me explain to you my life


(Pitbull)[Remix verse]
Day and night (day and night)
I found myself thanking god for my life (for my life)
'Cuz I took all the wrong and made it right (made it right)
And I picked rap instead of dealin' weight, weight, weight
I took my fathers hustle (fathers hustle)
And I took all of my family struggles (family struggles)
And I mixed it up with all my mothers pain (mothers pain)
Whatchu see is whatchu get, Pitbull's the name, name, name

(HOOK x2)
'Cuz day and night (day and night)
I find myself alone in this fame (in this fame)
They own my music but not my mind (not my mind)
They can try but they can't stop my hustle, grind, grind, grind

(Kid Cudi)[Verse 1}
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of

I grew up listenin to Luke, and... and... and pumpin Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies
I seen them trying to bring you down
But fuck that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters
I remember the Temple at Onyx, I was too drunk to get in
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win
Ya'll can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end

Dammit been paying dues, now it's my time to blow
Even when 50 come through
He don't roll no less than 50 zoes!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows
My dog Noseshaker, come through the block on something clean
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up

I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat
I love it when these boys come from out of town
And think Miamis sweet
All of them down looking for pussy, trying to Miami skeet
That's when they run up in they hotel room
And give them a Miami treat
When the choppers start a raining, it's hard to stop a Miami leak
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach

[Outro: Pitbull]
Hah, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash Ha ha ha
If the moneys on the wood, it's all good
But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305, ha ha haEmbed"

Now they coming down looking for Pit
Like I'ma prick at a new price
I done gave the streets new life
Like bricks in the drought
Banana clips man we pulling them out
Hustlers we filling them out
To see if they're willing or not
To put they're freedom on the line
When the feds start playing tricks on they mind
Like them ghettos boys
Fiends on bikes with no tires, that's ghetto boy
So all them hustlers on the corner sitting on milk crates
May your dreams come true one day
To all my boys behind bars, you know who you are
Keep your head up, I promise I got you

So you know Mr. worldwide had to check in
This beat’s perfect for me to teach the world a little bit more about me

[Verse 1:Pitbull]
Before you speak, listen
I always make it happen
I don’t believe in wishing or wishes or should've or would've or could've or can't or won't
So don’t, don’t come to me with that there
Epitome of irony, I’m a gentleman bastard
Burn me, throw me in the ocean, ya'll can keep the casket
I see who you not so let's see how long that mask fit
My whole life’s been a flagrant fail but somehow I still made the basket
Yeah they all tough behind the mic, I bet
Until they get they ass kicked
I’m a diamond in the rough I ain't cut right
And make sure when you cutting things that they're cut right
I don't floss, I don't rock ice, but if you listen and learn
Then I just might
Show you how I took my life from soft white
To playing cards with Rihanna at the same night
In Tokyo baby, let's ride
Now that’s what you call two diamonds in the sky

[Hook:Rihanna]
Shine bright, tonight you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You’re a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

That's why its called the ""Magic City"", it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
Cuz the last thing you wanna do is get lost
Cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes

Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Mami got that bubble-yum booty
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said ""Do you own Nike?""

Ladies and gentlemen
I like to introduce you all to a new game
It's called Dope Ball
Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time, very different
Goes a lil' something like this

[Verse]
It's not pick 'n' roll, it's more like pick a roll
What you gon' push? We waste a blow
If it's all 3, then that's the 3 from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams off the top of the key
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm' cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap hoes
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's
Next thing you know your puttin' numbers on the boat
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports
Both international, import, export
Extort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought
Extort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought

[Outro]
Dope Ball, dope ball, we play, we play
We playin' dope ball, dope ball
This is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball
I know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a dope ball
Hahaha
Thought that would entertain you all for a little bit
Little idea I came up with sitting at the crib
Watching the ocean, thinking about things we used to do back in the day

But that means money's everything and for that money y'all make, them choppers sing
I'll make them coppers bring
That yellow tape 'cause the whole thing
Can turn into a homicide scene if you fuck with the cream, mane
And I know Trick

But I let you slip, I let you slide
But I hope you motherfuckers don't think I'ma let you die

Nigga, I'm from down here where everything fucked up
And every other month, the dope prices going up
And either you thugging down here or you in the church
'Cause how I'm living, ain't nothing like you see on BET
These crackers found five dead in the last week
So if you a pussy nigga, you better get the fuck out these streets
These young niggas 16 and 17 going Fed
These crackers hitting these young niggas with 20-year bids
How the fuck you get indicted? You never had a quarter brick
But down here, that's how these pussy crackers play shit
And where I'm from, we respect Chevys more than we do Bentleys
'Cause a motherfucking Bentley can't fit them 26's
And that money come a little faster out here in the south
We got the corner, nigga, and got our own dope house
And you can find me with a white tee with my pants dropped
With four at the bottom, pussy nigga, and four at the top

To all the women out there, motivated

Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
If you only knew where I came from

Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
(Call it the million-dollar dream!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Banga Banga Bang Bang Bang
Pit in this thanga thanga thang thang
Swing it (da) dang lang lang lang
Off the chain-a lang lang lang
Took this game-a game game game
Created my own line-a line line line
Can't you see I'm loco?
Insane in the membrane
My hearts so cold, my bloods just chill
I'm not Cypress Hill, but imma be real
AK-4-7, full banana clip
Dale more ninito, Go 'head banana [?] like

Vein's in thanga thang thang thang
Flippin' the game-a game game game
You's too big to say your name
But now petty is my name-a name name name
You must understand you can't control us
We came from nothing but could you throw us
We couldn't even afford fruit roll-ups
Now I'm rolling up whips that make you throw up
Big shout out to the teachers that told me I never was gonna be shit
Big shout out to the non-believers that see me ridin my dick
Big shout out to the teachers that told me I never was gonna be shit
Big shout out to the non-believers that see me ridin my dick

Wish you could see how good it feels to say
Fuck you, pay me, cause that's the only way

Driving Around, looking in the mirror

Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
If you only knew where I came from
Came from, came from
Came from, came from
Came from, came from
Came from, came from
Came, came, came , came

(Call it the million-dollar dream)
[Verse 3: David Rush]
Now rush in this thing - wait!
They already know that
Imma bullshit, like an MJ throwback
Remember when haters say I used to be so wack
And a girlfriend with a pic like Kodak

The road been long
But I've through with the wheels of an F-150
And adapted to me
Brought 25, my fame hit the morning
Miss me!
But I'm still here, am I?
Making my dreams a reality
And if you wanna take that from me
You're gonna have to pull that outta me

They try to say this ain't real
And everything's not what it seems
But Imma laugh all the way to the bank
Call it the million-dollar-dream!

It's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life
I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Learn my stride?
Love for the passion... ?

All I know is the hustle and grind
All you want is some quality time
I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose
My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I need mine
There I go again being selfish
And there you go again the love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more you or the booth
These are just the things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex
I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life
I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Learned my stripes

Quieres que te lleve conmigo a la playa
Pide lo que quieras pero no te vayas
No traigas la ropa solo la toalla
Vamos a matar

Echa pa' acá
Porque mi música te mueve así
Y te libera de toda tensión
Que sepa todo el mundo que fui yo

El ritmo nuevo que se mete en ti, eh
Dile a tu novio que es un perdedor
Si no se pega lento, piense en mí
Pero es que en esto yo soy el mejor

[Verso 2: Pitbull]
I'm a mover, shaker, go getta, hustler
Don't stop, get it, get it, baby, trust me
See those two women? Yeah, they just met, (jaja)
See those two women? Yeah, they just left
Up to the hotel room
You don't gotta be a psychic to know what comes next
Armandito, qué rico, ay, ay, ay, ay, chico

Conectado de España a Puerto Rico

Más blanquito que Sammy, me cago en los grammys

Mami, yo no soy egoísta
La cosa es que yo sé lo que quiero

Egoísta, egoísta
Ego-ego-eh, ego-ego-ah

[Verso 1: Belinda, Pitbull]
Di todo para ti, y nada para mí
¿Por qué será así? (Egoísta)
En un mundo feliz, amar es compartir
Es dar y recibir, ¡egoísta!
I just know what I want
Comunica claro, mami, deja la muela
""Dime con quién tú andas y te digo quién tú eres""
Como dice mi abuela
Aquí no hay tiempo
El tiempo es dinero, y el que no entiende

Dale hasta abajo y se menea ese bumper
Rompe la pista, también la vajilla

En el meneo son las mas que se guillan
Tiran pa'lante cuando el combo las pilla

Desеo de una noche loca
Miel, entra en mi taxi
Envie d’une nuit de folie
Chéri, viens dans mon taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

No me importa si están casados
Je me fiche qu’elle soit mariée

O no quiero que sea sólo para mí
Je ne tiens pas à m’installer

Yo no quiero que sea sólo para mí
Je ne veux pas qu’elle soit ma propriété

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi
Cuando ella entra en el coche
Quand elle monte dans la gova

Me chasquido de los dedos, hacia la discoteca!
Je claque des doigts on fait une te-boî3

Copa de Champagne, Bébé relajarse!
Coupe de Champagne, bébé, détend-toi !

Esta noche no volver a casa
Ce soir tu ne rentres pas chez toi

No, no, no, usted no va a volver
Non, non, non tu ne rentreras pas

No, no, no
Non, non, non

Ella sonríe, se pega a mí
Elle sourit, se colle à moi

Sobre mí, sus nalgas hacen bam-bam
Ses fesses sur moi font bam-bam

Ella sigue el sonido bam-bam, bam-bam
Elle suit le son bam-bam, bam-bam
Sonido en la sangre bam-bam, bam-bam
A ça dans le sang bam-bam, bam-bam

Dulce chupetón bam-bam, bam-bam
Un doux suçon bam-bam, bam-bam

Ella suspiro y se estremece bam-bam, bam-bam
Elle soupire et frissonne bam-bam, bam-bam

En el taxi la conocí en camino por un basil
Dans le taxi je l’ai rencontrée en chemin vers la mairie
Estaba sexy, pero tan sexy
Elle était sexy, oui tellement sexy

Que por poquito arrojamos un tipo y chocamos el taxi
Que pour un peu on écrasait un type avec le taxi

Era el chofer, el que dijo: « ! Oye, mira esa mujer! »
C’est le chauffeur qu'a balancé « hey vise un peu cette beauté ! »

Esta dura, ah dura, que dura
C’était dur, tellement dur, bien trop dur

Pero ya tu sabes que ella quiere efectivo dinero
Pourtant tu sais qu’elle court effectivement après l'argent

Y saque chula, lula con culo de mula
Dis poliment : Une pieuvre avec ...un cul d'jument !

Yo la conocí en el taxi, En camino al club
Je l’ai connue dans le taxi, sur le chemin du club

Yo la conocí en el taxi, En camino al club
Je l’ai connue dans le taxi, sur le chemin du club

Me lo paro

Envie d’un chauffeur sexy
Qui saura te guider avec les yeux sur le chemin du désir

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

Detrás de todo lo inflama, oh este calor
A l’arrière tout s’enflamme, oh cette chaleur

Se quita toda su ropa, oh mi dios es horrible ...Todo!
Elle retire tous ses vêtements, oh my god c’est torride ...Tout !

Lloro como Homero Simpson, conmocionado
Je crie comme Homer Simpson, choqué

Su bola me hace perder la pelota
Son boule me fait perdre la boule

Me olvido de mi gira
J’en oublie ma tournée

Y suena el tel, los otros esperan
Et le tel sonne, les autres attendent

Ellas van a tomar ... Ho yay! levantó me, hop!
Elles vont me prendre ...Ho yey ! Me lever, hop !

Deseo de una noche loca
Miel, entra en mi taxi
Envie d’une nuit de folie
Chéri, viens dans mon taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

Yo yo yo me paro el taxi
J'a j'a j'a j'arrête le taxi

Con te no voy a ir suave en absoluto
Avec toi je n’irai pas tout doux du tout

50 tonos de taxis, querido deleita ...Hooo !
50 nuances de taxi, chérie savoure ...Hooo !

Ella sigue el sonido bam-bam, bam-bam

Pitbull) Lyrics[Pitbull:]
I'm feeling so emotional
'Cause I'm no longer close to you
Tell me what am I suppose to do
It was all about you
Till the point

New Year's
I'd toast to you
Everything I did
I did for you, baby

I'd lie for you
I'd kill for you
I'd die for you
I'd ride for you

Now you're holding hands
With another man
Making love to you

I'm feelin foolish
Looking at your picture
Drinking liquor
Thinking how can we do this
You might also likeHaters and intruders are the reason
That we are no longer together
Now my heart's like a cooler ice cold
But the pain still burns

It's true
Time heals are wounds
You live and learn
But karma's a bitch
And baby you'll get your turn

[Verse 1:]
Damn
Somebody tell me why
The first girl I see
When I walk up in the club
Her nigga
You told me that you was gon make sure
I wasn't gonna see this girl

No, no tonight
I wanted to give it time
I wanted her out of my mind
Now it's too late to leave

Damn
I wonder who is that she's talking to
He put the drink down
Now he's making a move
I wonder where they movin' to
And just like a fool
I'm watching her
Tryna make eyes deter

But I can't stop watching
(I'm watching)
Said I can't stop watching
(I'm watching)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now the only thing I feel
Inside of my chest
Is all this regret

I never should've let you go
Why'd I let you go?
This situation is under my skin
There's a war going on within

[Chorus:]
This is how I feel
Every time I'm around you
I just lose control
When I'm in the same room
I get so
I'm so
Emotional (emotional, emotional)

[Verse 2:]
So what do you think?
Should I roll up
Like I do it on dubs

Show her what it is
Make her miss my love
Yeah, reminisce on us

Look at me stressing
So caught up
Learning my lesson
I realize

But now it's too late
Cause he just wrapped his hands
Around that slim waist

That's my waist
Please don't tell me she's dancing
The same way

Man, that could never be
That's what she said to me
That's why it's so hard to believe

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Hey, girl
Didn't see you standing there
It's been a long time
It's feeling really good
To see your smile

Every once in a while
I'm thinking of you and me
But life is good
I'm free, yeah

Wait, baby
I'm fronting honestly
I made a big mistake
I'm struggling with reality
It hurts more every day

I been blaming you
For making me feel this way
And now I'm crushed without your love

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I know it's straight to the point
But I'd rather be straight up and straight forward
Instead of playing with your heart and your mind
Games are waste of time
Now we can do the nasty and do what it do and see what it does
Either we gon' love what we do to each other
Or just let it be what it was
No harm, no foul, no commitment, no vows
Maybe a contract or two
But by that time I'm already tired of the way you like it, ooh
And let your body decide (Decide), exactly what it does (Does)
But it's no secret baby, everybody fucks

Cool me down
I'm feeling so exotic (Red One)
Yaa right now...
I'm hotter than the Tropics
Take me down (Mr. Worldwide)
Mumbai Cuba baby let's go (Priyanka)
La-love me all the way to Rio

(Desi girl)
I'm feeling so exotic

Tumko jo dekha maine
Toh maine ye jaan liya hai
Pardesi babu ne
Iss desi dil ko maan liya hai (x2)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm like Bon Jovi...
I'm wanted dead or alive
And you all better get with it
And in the music game
I'm worth more dead than alive
But that's okay, I live with it
That's why I live everyday like my last
Priyanka step on the gas
From Morocco to Mumbai
Bollywood to Hollywood is all about the money
Hey!

But if you want the world
I suggest you come with me (come with me)
La-la la la la... (Come with me)

Cool me down
I'm feeling so exotic

Mumbai Cuba baby let's go
La-love me all the way to Rio

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
To Cuba's free, I can't go
But I'll meet you in Rio for sure
But before I make a pit stop in Miami
Home of the Heat and the old school photos
Got women by the boat loads
Went from Tootsies, Rolex and Cocos
To the Exhumers, Turks and Caicos
No more rumors maybe say say SOS
It's a fact that Pit is no liar
Give me a radio we'll take the entire
Ms World & Mr Worldwide
You already know that this thing is on fire

I'm something like a pimp when I put my words on the track, slap

And I can give you and all you can see

Time is money

Only difference is I own it

Like a stop watch let's stop time

And enjoy this moment, dale

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

Ten cuidado que yo vengo a cien, preparate
Yo no juego juegos
Lo unico que tengo es mi palabra y los dos huevos
So respeten el movimiento
Oye y deja el invento, penco
Mira papo lo siento
Pero la verdad es que ellos no pueden con esto
Y si tu creen que lo tienen bien puesto
Entonces ponte apuesto

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pl-pl-pl-playing a part
All they talk about is they money, je-je-je-jewels and cars
So put pha-pha-phatoms and bentleys and how they squeeze 'til it's empty
How they move; yay, hooray!
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talkin' 'bout
Wha-wha-what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str straight to they mama's house
Like southern Cali ,they hardly make it rain or drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzles for shizzles
Uh, tell 'em!

Jim Johnson
Mr. 305
Puttin' it down with the mamita rica Kristinia DeBarge
Now forget about the past
Look past the present
'Cause it's all about that future love
Dale

[Verse 1: Kristinia DeBarge]
Couple of years, I'm gonna know your name
Like I waited for you forever
I know this might sound insane
It won't be long
'Till we're gonna take this up
I'm talking about our future love

[Verse 2]
So far away
Maybe you're right next door
I'm picturing your face again
Something worth waiting for
Put all lovers behind me, they don't live up
I know what I want, what I need to the tee

[Chorus: Kristinia DeBarge]
Baby, if they ask me, I would say I don't know your name
When they ask me, ""Does it change?""
It don't change a thing
There's something about the way you love me
Something about the way you know me
And I can't explain it enough
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Just something 'bout our future love, future love, future love
Something 'bout our future love, future love, future love

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I wanna give you the best of me
Strong woman strong man, that's the recipe
Would you be my future love?
Dale, muñeca, say yes to me (Say yes to me)
Let me take your breath away (Your breath away)
I would change my life for yours (My life for yours)
Come here, stand next to me
My future love, my destiny
I wanna be (I wanna be) your future love
Just you and me (just you and me)
Your future love
I wanna be (I wanna be) your future love
Just you and me, just you and me (You and me)

[Chorus: Kristinia DeBarge]
Baby, if they ask me, I would say I don't know your name
When they ask me, ""Does it change?""
It don't change a thing
There's something about the way you love me (Ooh)
Something about the way you know me
And I can't explain it enough
[Post-Chorus]
Just something 'bout our future love, future love, future love
Something 'bout our future love, future love, future love

[Verse 3: Kristinia DeBarge]
Hand in hand on our second date
I can picture us touching, your kiss I can almost taste
I've imagined all the ways
We'll meet for the very first time
I can see the place, feel the love at first sight

[Chorus: Kristinia DeBarge]
Baby, if they ask me, I would say I don't know your name (Oh)
When they ask me, ""Does it change?""
It don't change a thing
There's something about the way you love me (Ooh)

Thank God that the world
Has so many freaks
That know how to wild out
And if they got a man on the low
Best believe that they pose
And they know how to hide out
Everybody wanna freak the freak wit
Pitbull's the Latin
Version of Freaknik
So
Dale loca y abre la boca
You know what to do
They're ain't no rules
In the freak game
If you like your hair pulled
And your ass slapped, better hit it from the back
Let it be known
All my mamas that think they too fit to get freaky
Y'all better be gone
But see, to play this game
Y'all gotta Pl-Play with Skillz
It's that little chico, Pitbull
From the bottom
With them boys, Play-N-Skillz
Encouraging all the freaks
To get out and get, get, get, get freaky
I'm a hundred percent freak
Just lookin' for a freak that can get with me
[Pitbull]
Como (Como)
Como
Get-get-get, get, get, get, get, get, get
Get, get, get, get freaky

Repeat Chorus & Hook

[Verse 2: Play]
You don't give a damn that your man's in love with you
You be thinking 'bout me when he fucking you
I got plans if it lands at the W
So just lose your dude, so we could rendez-vous
Come on, little mama, let me see what you got
Turn around, baby, let me hit the spot
Never lick the spot, but I'm a make it hot
Go ahead and take it off, you might sweat a lot
All I need is just a couple of minutes
But you ain't gon' trip that I'm already finished
Yes, I'm ready, get all up in it
Hit it real steady til I'm almost finished
Head back from the batch, you could feel it in the middle
Bring it back, make it clap, might slap a little
We can do it one on one, little privacy
But it's gotta be my way, girl, promise me
Pre-Chorus:
[Play]    Face down
Ass up
That's the way I like to fuck
We don't need no room
We can take it to the truck (I guaruntee)
Sweet Dreams, if you fuck with me
Leave your man, come with me so we can
[Pitbull] Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky

Repeat Chorus & Hook

[Verse 3: Skillz]
Sweet Dreams are made of these
Leave your man and come with me
It's whatever
You wanna do
Hit it from the back til we both get through
Get, get, Give It All You Got
Go to the room
Go to the car
I don't give a fuck
I'm a superstar
I still go hard
Never go wrong
Come to the bar, the Patron's on me
After the club, we can go to my suite
One on one, we could have some fun
Bring a friend
Twice the fun
I'll bring my friends, you bring your friends
We can be friends
I bring super skills
More role boss insane

Ko ti dici dila,  ko to tamo repa
Panduri slušaju, zapisuju sve šta san reka
Pitaj me kako san pa vidi sta san steka
Sedmašice me vole više nego nekad
Ja san onaj model šta na đoku ti se šlepa
Moj glas na traci siće te jaka seka
Brokvan te ka beka pilan te ka sika
Svaki ludi lik iz tvog kvarta mi je prika
Najmanje šta imam je izbrisana psiha
Parice i cvića iman više nego ikad
Ja ti tresem žile bolje i od žutog
Deset ge origana platija si skupo

Bitch, we going down

**It's the bottom mate**
Between what they talk right
**DJ Ideal!**
DJ Ideal, what they do

[Hook: Pitbull]
I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

Growing up I had my fair share of family problems
Now I'm grown, touch my family if you want a problem
I'm a die hard fan of, making money
Now my money makes me money, now I'm making money
Everyday I thank god that I'm making money
Is your friend a foe, will you ride or rode
This is the life I chose, no longer selling oz
El Mariel, with God's help boy, it will blow
I've attained, the unattainable
Done, the unimaginable
It's unbelievable like B.I.G when he died a passenger
I think B.I.G ride with God as a passenger
Keep hating while I'm passing ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paull Wall]
It's Paul Wall from the Swisha House beat
I've only been grinding and hustling, since I was six
Remember back in the days, I used to drink tabs
Now I buying at the bar, baby put it on my tab
I'm a national prospect, like my boy Brandy Washington
I'm sipping on that bar, so you never see me coughing
I've never had a cavity, you know I stay flossing
And Imma keep hustling 'til they put me in the coffin
I got some good advice from box and papa Joe
If I swallow all my pride then my bliss is to blow
I shoot a kite to my dawg Roger
Locked up in the form, he doing 45
Hey, got him tatted on my arm
Catch me at the sky bar, posted low key
Reminiscing 'bout the old school with my OG's
If you waiting for me to fly, the JTRL
I can buy my sound skins, so you know Imma sell
I got an album called the People's Champ, In stores now
I got them diamonds in my mouth, baby bling bling bow
It's Paul Wall baby, representing Swisha House
Y'all already know, umm, it's going down
[Hook]

[Outro: Paul Wall & Pitbull]

Hey, if you trying to get a grill in your mouth
Fuck with this TV jewelry

Top quality diamonds
You know what I'm talking bout
I let my boy TV done it
Paul Wall, the people's champ baby

(Pitbull)
Lassarito, I appreciate the love

Mike Calderon come pinga, que bola
Juan filipi come mierda, que bola
Julio mamatranca, que bola
Look out for El Mariel coming out
Spanish Album behind it coming out
Called Armando, so ya tu sabe
Preparase porque la cosa va esta fea
Dale joputa que bola con PitEmbed"

[Verse 7: Jermaine Dupri]
They call me the leader of the silly shit jus ask my counting
Ya'll niggas make it rain I call my shit the water fountain
Because that with a push of a button shawty, you could get more
Homie, why they think they leave you when I walk through the door?
If I had to compare myself to any I'm something like a Spartan
Jay be the big stage in the A since Martin
Double rock the College Park, I mean what more can I say?
I switch my chain with my car, switch my car by the day
So fuck what'cha heard, I'm the man girlfriend
Pulling up in the race cars, this nigga just got a Benz (A-Ha)

My charm too silly, my flow's just silly
Plus I keep the grand daddy purp at my shows, I'm silly

Went from nobody to fortune plus my fame is silly

All y'all hear is POP, like the Black Eyed Peas album
I'm 'bout to run rap soon
By bringin' drama like 50 and Game is in the same room
In My Hood
Policia we no hablamos
We push so much white
They call us albinos
My street advantage is (What is it?)
I got more guns
Than the Puerto Rican Day parade got baby carriages
Street savages, you can't stop or hold me
Nothin' gets by me in the game like a soccer goalie
I gotta lay behind me, fold more paper than origami
Chino keep the finest mamis, tryin' to get pregnant by me
When grippin' the mini-shotty, I'm finishin' anybody
The minister tried to stop me, now Jay-Z is tryin' to sign me

[Verse 2: Sinful]
Porque haste ahora, se sorprenden y otros se ofenden
Porque haste ahora, me cienten si he estado aqui por siempre
Atrapado en una calle con ciego y inconciente
Ahora, los soñadores platica fue por suerte
Doce años en el juego y no es suficiente
Por favor, miren, mocosos, ya mejor, despierten
Yo se que me encanta el ambiente sigo indigente
En el mismo lugar, de siempre, con la misma gente
Puedes traer tu arsenal, pero no te combiene
Un corazon artificial, como se defienden
Tu vieja te detiene, se te pone por enfrente
Y tu no sales, tu te escondes como una serpiente
Es como mezclar tequila con un vaso de leche
Una movida falsa y tu systema no sostiene
Y por aqui sigue tronando esas cosas calientes
Conozco a franco tiradores que no usan lentes
Repeat Chorus Twice

Now when them boys get to poppin', you'll get, get, down
When them choppers spit
Spit
Sp-spit, spit, rounds
Round of town, upstate, so shake
So shake it down
Get them boys, get them thangs, but break
But break 'em down
From the bottom of the panhandle, where birds get manhandled
From the pot
To the block
Where they hand-to-hand you
Cook that white with Sprite, that's if we wanna scam you
Pitbull, Rich Boy, we got plans too
Don't pull out
Unless, of course, you spit boy
Squeeze out
To the bottom of that clip, boy
Just to reassure your ass got hit, boy
Make thirty-six shows to a 360, that's a flip, boy

I want to rock right now
My name's Vein and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to get your girl alone
I got more game, but girls believe me
I have a sweat before that you could see me
Could it be I'm about to be on TV
Because I'm hated by many that want to be me
Fo' sheezy, believe me
I does a bitch for no reason
Four rooms at the four seasons
She guaranteed to have to stop breathin'
I'm leanin',but after we get through
Girl I'm leavin',Back to the club to try to sneak in
And bring something home for the weekend (get up!)

Back, back, back, back it up!
It's Jay R, straight acting up
With Pitbull, Julio G
From one glass you know wassup
I see  her looking from a mile away
Cause I be balling out like it's a holiday
Got a pocket full of that stripper money
Every chance I get paid I say

[Verse 1: Yung Jay R]
Mami what your staring for?
You wanna come with us?
Bottles full of champagne
If you tryna catch a bus
You call it love or lust
Call it anything you want
We can rain on your body
Money goes, money goes
Bankteller gonna check the funds
Back and forth like he ain't got the runs
That's here my lifestyle
Baby I do this shit for fun
Let's do this right now
Baby, I'd have you tapping out
From Bedroom, to the resting table
To living room on a couch
You might also like[Hook: Yung Jay R]
Throw your hands up in the air
Wave like you just don't care
I'm just trying to get with you
Show me what to freaking do
I ride it like a Maserati
Me in on your body
I'm just trying to get with you
Show me what to freaking do

Drop it low, touch your toes
Mami, how low can you go
The way your body moving slow
I'd be like vamonos
I just wanna take you home
So shawty let me know
I just wanna take you home
So shawty let me know
Yea- let-let me know

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Boom Boom, Get out the way
Here comes a hurricane
I don't throw my money in the air
But I make that money rain
Mami, boy that thing so fatty
Look like an orangutan
I just wanna play up in it
Get it wet and stay up in it
Hold on, wait a minute
We both for dos
Ain't no time to brainwrestle baby
It's time for that dirty talk
Wake you and your hardly walk
You need, you text me baby
Si te cojo, to mojo, te engancho, te mancho
For sure!
[Hook: Yung Jay R]

[Verse 3: Julio G]
Shawty let me know
It's Julio G back at it again
Let's take a trip through that lost lost stable
We do it big, just everyday
You know that I'm with it
Through silence, Mami I ain't here to pretend
Let me know where to begin
Cause we can get on poppin
And girl, you know we ain't stoppin
Everything's just on me
Just sit back and relax
These other dudes can't do it like me (Nah!)
They can't do it like me, come by and you'll see!
They can't do it like me, come by and you'll see!

[Hook: Yung Jay R]

Walk up in the club with this big ass medallion
Throwin up the dub like niggas from Staten Island
Who that that do that diamonds all blue black
The critics don't get it they think I'm one of those new cats
I'm a dog a rottweiler, ask Rockwilder
When Game and Lloyd come through in that drop 'Palla
It's Murder! Irv don't hurt 'em
When he come through in the Phantom the same color as syrup
I'm a criminal individual smooth as Beyonce
Skin I'm thick I stand out like Frank Lucas
Mink in the club cause I'm too iced out
You feelin me I'm feelin you let's get you wifed out
Throw on my Louis V belt and bring them new Nike's out
It's BlackWallStreet and Murder INC, lights out

Yea, take the passport, freak'um fly status
Got a chick in every area code, it don't matter (nope)
When daddy come home, drop the thong, no chatter (nope)

Ella, ella anda sola y sola lo hizo

Comenzó la fusión
Chino me envío esta y me dijo que es (yes) Crunkaton (raa)
Rápido me monte sin discusión (wooo)
Llegó el nene (ya) luces, cámara, acción
Este ritmo no caduca
Camarera pásame la hooka
Hooka pa tomarla como jugo fruta (woo)
Ella se lo bebe y lo disfruta (yaa)
Se me trepa encima y se me parte como yuca yuca

[CORO]
Se fue en vicio (se fue en vicio)
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Dile al DJ que no pare la music, que es hasta al piso (DJ no lo pare)
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Ella anda sola (sola) y sola lo hizo
Se fue en vicio (se fue vicio)

Me not workin' hard? Yeah right

Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo & Nayer]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know
We might not get tomorrow, let's do it tonight

Nothing is enough, 'til they handle love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you to stay, I want you tonight

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (Hey)

Take advantage of tonight (Yeah)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (Yeah)
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin', hustlers move in silence
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan (Woo)

At least you'll fall on top of the world

I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, haha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby baby
And it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest

And I ain't no gangsta, bitch
I'm a hustler, ho
And I got no problem
If you want it, you can get it
Boy, I bust you

[Verse 1]
Anybody wanna test? Hi, who? Me
P-I to the motherfuckin' T
It's not my fault that your bitch chose me
Now her and her girlfriend wanna do me
This is for those boys in those Chevys, sittin' on them King James
Them 2-3s
And if you got a problem with me, holler at my lawyer
Bitch, sue me
I'm tired of the fuck-boy rap, fuck-boy this, fuck-boy that
Watch a couple movies and they put it in they rhyme
Those wanna be fiddlers
I'm straight, you get shot nine times
Ten years in the game, since 99, I was speakin' my mind (Yes, sir)
And then shit changed, if you got a problem

Yo, matter fact, Delz
Do me a favor, hit these motherfuckers in the head
And let them know I'm that hot, scorching, gasoline
Funk on them shitbirds, these motherfuckers on contact
Go ahead and hit them in the motherfucking head
Welcome to Miami International Airport
Where the local time is now 11:10

[Verse 1: Jamie Drastik]
They say I'm going for a grammy, live from the 305
Straight from Miami, off the flight from New York
Nice landing and I ain't come down here for the tanning
I came for the takeovеr, understand the planning

[Hook: Kanye West & Jamie Drastik]
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus
I feel just likе you I mean even I hate us
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus
I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus
I feel just like you I mean even I hate us

[Verse 2: Jamie Drastik]
Rules are made to be broken, they ask me if i paid my dues
I'm looking back like ""Are you joking?""
Doors that are open, worries don't know what open
I started kicking and pushing and then I broke in
I'm on a flight that won't miss the runway, I'm too focused
Been through flight school, hurricanes, typhoons
Monsters, sand dunes that one shot like rifles
Tower like eiffel, I go cycle, for the fucking title
Kill 'em, lightbulb, trying to put a Billy to my name (Idol)
And you're my fucking idol if you never stayed idle
Pedal to the floor with your mind on survival
One hand on the mic, the other's on the bible
And hopefully, you go as just hard as I do
They say I'm the truth and if not, you've been lied to
You might also like[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
I got a lifetime beef with the beats
That's why I'm going hard everytime that we speak
They got a little nervous when I signed to the three
They said boom bat, I said click-clack
Spit it til they dead with a fresh mouth, tic tac
I'm done with all the riff-raff, they be like it's just rap
Til I send a bomb in the box with the gift wrap
Throners where I sit that, til I have it stiff back
I'm fine, I don't recline to ever sit back
Critics say I'm all hard, Where you left tits at?
I don't spit lies, I chew on the truth
To get to the roots sometimes you gotta pull the tooth
She told me to keep her, I gotta lose the roof
So I lost both and I regained my juice

[Verse 4: Jamie Drastik]
Some people say they feel they've been used
But that's bullshit, I can't use useless
That they can get just about as grey as the gooses
When I'm in the booth, they see clee translucent
Yeah, I never excuse the excuses
I killed this shit, take it off the to-do list

Man
I hate it when I'm in the club or out on the streets and
All these cats run up on me talkin bout what they doin, and
Who they set the liquor on or how many bricks they flippin and I mean
I really don't need to hear that shit to be honest with you dawg

[Chorus]
It's cool you flip birds, don't bring that shit around me
(guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you were snitches so don't come around me
(guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you talkin lick, don't talk that shit around me

[Verse 1]
Call me Miami haro haro, cause this deals with the track
Blows my mind like oh chea
Yeah, that's wrong, but it's real
Fuck boys they know the deal
Pit done started a revolution
Now all they wanna do is follow, follow, but chill
I went from tia servin me meals to makin a meal
So fuck with your deals, talk is cheap so fuck a grill
Miami got them boys that's real, trill
Now full of, gold, grills, sell steel
But only God knows that they kill bill
You can tell them boys is rookies
When they make it rain in the club
You know them boys is rookies
When they got a hundred ones under dub
I love it when they think they big time
But they just servin cookies
And I love it when they think they from the hood
And they just surburban pussies
I'm off in the sky boxing tootsies, with Pepe
Knock chasin' pussies, just lookin for investors
To back up this movement we pushin
I ain't comfortable so everything I make is kushin'
And every day comes nothin but stockin with sushi

[Verse 2]
Dime con quien tu van da, y te digo quien tu eres
Pitbull el rapero, pero negociante Armando Perez
I rap for them low key boys, get money, no keys
And thanks to this rap shit
I don't gotta hear nothin' bout' no keys boy
But it's like everywhere I go
Everybody pull up low by the boatloads (woah)
Then they get on records and rap about the shit
And cold like the dead don't know
These boys need to wake up and smell the cocaine
Cause this a different day and age in the rap game
Cause the feds, cabs, bobs
Wise they'll listen to everything that we say
You can deny it until you get federally indicted
Accounts frozen and family just put on a diet
Them big boys that push heavy weight know I ain't lyin
I'm tryin to blow til the point I can tell Donald Trump
""You fired."" I did what I had to do to get where I'm at
I push a little this, I push a little that
But now that the game has let me in I ain't never goin back
And man you can bet that
Havin problems movin weight?
Man, I wish I could help, but rap is my meal ticket
So keep them bricks to yourself
[Chorus]
It's cool you flip birds, don't bring that shit around me

All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It’s all I want
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
It’s all I want
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
It’s all I want

[Post-Chorus: The Wanted & Pitbull]
Baby, it’s all I want

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
You know I love an open mind (Mind)
So I can see what you thinking (Thinking)
That way I could give you exactly what you want
Matter of fact what you drinking (Drinking)
Some call it pimping, I call it leverage (Leverage)
I call it slipṗing, they call it marriage (Marriage)

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma, you can fuck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no carats
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
[Chorus: The Wanted]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It’s all I want
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
It’s all I want
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one

Mr. Worldwide
Across the world
Let's ride, Dale

[Verse 1: Nick]
I wake up every morning and see your face
Lying right beside me it fills the space
In my heart, I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
And every time I lay my head down to sleep
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat
So loud, I can't hear the sound
Do you hear it? For you

[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Verse 2: Howie]
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
But still somehow you keep on surprising me
I'm yours, I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you, I feel like I
Could be the luckiest man in the world
Why try to fight it?
There's no need to hide it, because, you know
You might also like[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again

I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Bridge: AJ]
Oh, feels like I, fall apart
Every time, where do I start?
(Without you)
I'm so helpless without you
Without you, yeah

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Every time I close my eyes
You're the first thing that runs to my mind
Everywhere I go, I see you, hear you, feel you
I just wanna be near you and heal you
Last thing you said is, ""How dare you""
First thing I said is, ""I'm sorry""
Now I'm sitting here helpless, man; same old story
Now she's brokenhearted, time heals all the wounds
She said, ""Not this time"", it's true, everyone plays a fool
And that fool is me, because I foolishly
Took advantage of a woman who loved me
[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without youEmbed"

I am what they wanna be, check the stats
James Bond in the flesh, girl, that's a fact
I was raised by OG's so I'm lowkey
I'm what you need in your life, better believe me
I'm a freak that can geek, that can beat
That can treat you like the queen that you was meant to be
I'm that good, I'm that raw, I'm that sick, I'm that dog
I'm that nothing to something, that have it all
Now mami, just watch, learn and listen
I got a feeling so good she stays twitchin'
But before I vanish she spoke Spanish
She said ""papito rico te necesito""
[Chorus: Romeo Santos]

Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'

If you touch me right
Then I might stay the night
Oh, we can take our time

I know we gotta say goodbye, but right now

En tu mirada yo lo puedo ver
Te mata mi estilo y eso yo lo sé

Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch

Nigga I'm a young king, nigga I'm a Bun B

Your man just left, I’m the plumber tonight
I'll check yo' pipes, oh you the healthy type
Well, here goes some egg whites

Now gimme that sweet
That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon’ do
Two plus two, I’m gon' undress you

Then we’re gonna go three and three
You gon’ undress me
Then we’re gonna go four and four
We gon’ freak some more, but first...

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends

Forget about your boyfriend

You can bring your girlfriends

After party in hotel lobby
Then we off to the room like vroom
Put them fingers in yo' mouth, or open up yo' blouse
And pull that g-string down south

Ooh, okay shawty, one’s company
Two’s a crowd and three’s a party
Your girl ain’t with it, I got somebody
In my nature, she’s naughty

Now gimme that sweet
That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon’ do
Two plus two, I’m gon' undress you

Then we’re gonna go three and three

She said she hits that pole
But that's the paper school
Yeah ok, but let me say
Do I look like some sort of motherfuckin' fool?
He know excusе, to where them boots
Just tеll em' like Biggie told em' give me the loot (Oo-o-h)
See what you do
You got me throwing money that I can't recruit

How many girls can we get up on the pole? (Let's see)

I make girls move like Sean Paul, Pitbull, Little Jon
With a little twist of low han
Low hand, no man could ever do the shit that I can
I am out my ""you know at the same time""
Everyone in as the same time
All join in on the same rhyme

He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
Cuz the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
Cuz a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction

Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
Now my father doesn't have shit
I don't have shit
We don't have shit
Cuz he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
That's cuz his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
Cuz this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now you're on the Lord's shit list
Now you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models
[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Verse 3]
I know about hustler's
But I won't mention no names
Cuz they still got cases pending
And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS
At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
Cuz that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
Cuz you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal
[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)Embed"

And they all dance for pappy, ha ha

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

[Rap Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine we could all get along
Won't be long
Til that day comes
Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons
Father, stop lookin' at every sports station
Take a second
And think of every poor nation
Making weapons
They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare
Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare
Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad
How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous
How do we escape these brainless acts of terror
I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better
Put our hearts in the right place
Humans of all colors
We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day
Imagine that

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

[Hook: John Legend]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

[Rap Verse 2: Pitbull]
America, the
Land of the free
America, the
Land of opportunity
America
What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty
If you turnin' refugees, back at sea
Music was made to move them
Even the devil he dances
I got a lot of questions
And I'm searching for answers
We taught to believe in religion, but religion's
The reason the Twin Towers are missin'
Listen
That was the past, but maybe now, you realize
The man above us the only thing
That keeps us alive
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love)
[John Lennon]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

When it all come down to her

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do
[Verse 3: Pitbull - with ""you do"" in the background]
Everything about you girl, it drives me wild
From your thighs to your eyes to the way you smile
I think about you, more than I should
You classy, sexy, yeah with a twist of hood
I'd love to put this tongue on you fast like Twista would
From the front, to the back I wanna make you feel good
Let me know baby what you want and how you want it hey
You know how boys get down when they from DADE! (Ayyyyooo)
Pitbull, T-Pain, girl this a G thang
Meanin we don't stop 'til we find the G spot
Picture us rollin in the seven tray, no top
With a 454 block, step on the gas
Like bad coca, step on they ass
If they try to stop what we got, come on mayne!
You like the blood in my veins, the air in my lungs
Bottom line, mami, I'm sprung (Ayyyyooo)
Wooo

[Bridge 2: T-Pain]
Oooh so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...
Now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her
[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

[Verse 5: Trick Daddy - with ""you do"" in the background]
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone (deep in the zone)
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's (Benihana's)
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

[Bridge 3: T-Pain]
She got me doin, what I won't do
Got me sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end you'll see that
She got you doin, what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see, she
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you, she
Got you
Got you
Got you, when it all come down to her

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

All in my feelings
Baby got me all in my feelings
Used to be the one she used to call for the lovey dovey
Now she got another nigga in it
You know I try
To be the one in your life
To say I never loved you, that's a lie, lie, lie
Every day I miss when you were mine, mine, mine
Shawty got the hoops in, pretty with the titty
Haitian and Cuban, girl, you too litty
Whenever we touch, roll shut down city

While I'm under bitches with bitches and all of them mad
Hittin' everythin' that they pitchin'
Ain't no need to be mad, grow up and be a man lil' boy
Keep messin' with them
Little Instagram or Snapchat stragglers
Think it's a game? Let's play
And get your ass stuck up like Kim K

Girl, do you remember when I put that smile up on your face?
Do you remember when I wiped those tears up off your face?
In December, I came and shoveled the snow away
'Cause forever, I'm there for you to be my bae
'Cause I gave you the keys to my house
Went and took you to Porto

Yea niggas, Welcome to Dade County
Where we slang rocks that claim blocks
And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot
C'mon and ride with a nigga so I can show you what Dade County really got
See don't be fooled by South Beach
Thinking when you come to the Bottom you can just run these streets
You and your jewels are like a menu
And trust me nigga we intend to eat
F**k around and cross that I-395
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets
Niggas with wifebeaters and bare feet
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style
Go beyond that about 3 miles and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie ""Scarface""
But the wrong move in this place, you'll f**k around and meet the real Tony Montana
So f**k them palm trees
I got shit for you to really see
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub with niggas buried 4 generations deep
And I ain't even talking about sister lined next to brother

I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other
And all that rap about you're Lil Haiti connections?
Nigga you don't even know a real zo
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door
Put you faced down on the floor
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago
But you a star, though
Okay, nigga if you a real G
This is where you tell your car to go
Opa Locka
Where there is continuous spotlight helicopters and a triangle full of choppers
Carol City will make holes in you so big, they can't be plugged by doctors
Nigga, this is the real Dade County
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hurst
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a pyrex
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet
So Welcome to Miami-Dade County, the real Miami

(1st Vrs)
Hmmmmm-Mmmmm x2(Yeah)
Must be nice
Having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

(Chorus)
Even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those 20's stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here

Must be nice
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

[Verse 1]
Mami what's up wit ya' I just wanna get to know you better
Mami you tight work and I know I could get you wetter
I know you hear this a lot and I know you fed up
I know life is hard but you gotta keep ya' head up
You got the real game, check
Nail game, check
Hair game, check
Everything, check
That's why I can't wait to slip off your clothes
And lick you from head to toe
And give you some of this fire head till you explode
I wanna make you cum till you can't cum no more (ay, que rico)
I wanna see you curl up your toes (ay, que rico)
I wanna be the one to turn you out (ay, que rico)
I'ma show you what I be about
I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man
That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn
Girl I love this
And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy

It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store
You've got those body parts, I just wanna explore
Como me vuelves loco, ven paca mi amor
You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues
Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose
Nothing at all, except climbin the walls (ay, que rico)

Fat Joe the Don!
And Mr. Worldwide reporting live from the east
Ross the boss, Mr. Mauricio
I know paper, can buy the newspapers
Millions now, billions later
You gotta let these haters

[Hook: Mr. Mauricio]
Jam on it, jam on it
I tell ‘em, tell ‘em jam on it!
Jam on it, jam on it
J-j-j jam on it!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Mr. 305, to Mr. Worldwide
To Mr. Take Something
Make something, that’s right!
For hanging with dark goons and gangsters
To doing business with investors, attorneys and bankers
Same story, different suits
Same chico just under a different roof
Instead of the corner of the block
Is the corner of the office
I’m nauseous from offers!
And when I see women is ménages they offer
And you know that I’m all for!
Especially if they’re both on our fours
And you can keep them, dawg, they’re all yours!
Two seven figure Dade County boys
Not even John Lennon could imagine that
Our new paper can buy the newspapers
Millions now, billions later!

[Bridge: Mr. Mauricio]

Shatke that ass and grab that pole, and drop it low
Let’s go! And lil momma to the floor
Shake that ass and grab that

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
I jam on it, I jam on it
Bitches scream like they see Joe Jonas
Yelling mousseline smell the trees all on it
She need new jeans cause she creamed all on it
Hold up! Twerk the shit
Hannah Montana I swerve the bitch
Versace roll on Versace down
Even put a beat under the Versace house
She no speaking ingles
And my bitches all foreign
Brazilian hair and the ass she was born with!
Pay attention, you niggas can’t afford it
But not your ass take her just pouring!

To get nasty;
To get freaky;
To do things you've never done before;
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever

One time for the land down under
Two times for Mr. Worldwide
Three times for the gorgeous Jessica
Now let's ride

[Verse 1: Jessica Mauboy]
I met a fella at the bar
I know he slipped me something strong
Said, ""Won't you be my Valentine for the night?""
I said, ""Who do you think you're talking to?
Before this girl gets cute with you
I need to see the way you move
If I'm gon' call you mine""

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Oh, I'm not falling to my knees
You know I'm one of a kind
If you really wanna take a chance on me
Then dance on me, let's unwind

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Just get up on your heels
The bass drop and the keys just won't stop
Here's the D, you're gonna dance with me tonight
Swing from here to there
Let go of all your cares
A ride to love and fate
Gotta dance with me tonight

[Verse 2: Jessica Mauboy]
They say that you're the cat's meow (Meow)
I'm curious what you're about
You're dangerous without a doubt
But, it's alright
You may or may not be the one
For now we're only having fun
You talk like you've already won
But we still got the night

I got a bad habit of being with women that look like Jessica Rabbit
You know I gotta have it, tag it, rip and grab it
Lick it, stick it, kiss and bag it
I love it when they keep they heels on and clothes off (Right)
I'm tryna find my mind but it's so lost
I'm tryna turn you on and get you so off
These boys act like they hard but they so soft
Visa to visa, country to country
Sending here bees and the women who love me
They sayin' they need me, they sayin' they want me
Catch me in the Bahamas eatin' Chonky Conky
Getting harder than the FK, huh
Just so I can F that
I don't need the pope to bless that
That's what I'm here for, babe dale
Woo!

Yo Jim, how can I say this without saying it?
It's your boy Qwote, and Mr. World Wide

I was wondering, if you don't mind
Can I get a kiss from those lips, kiss from those lips

Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Get a kiss from those lips, kiss from those lips

[Verse 1: Qwote]
I had an epiphany in my Cadillac
Just the thought of it make my fucking eyes roll back
That's hard to look with them pretty red lips
And the way your soft hands will feel around my (ooooh)
I know you get the picture now of what I'm saying
You on your knees, I ain't talking about praying
I'm all one soul you know I'm feeling right
Little mama gimme a sip of what I would like
Girl I'm motivated and ready from that pone
And the way your jeans are hugging, driving me crazy
So let's take it back to my hotel, hotel
Pop a bottle, get low and blow it like you do

And baby you could get freaky, yeah that's cool
You could get loose, yeah that's cool
You could have a drink, yeah that's cool
Put you up on the bar, yeah that's cool
The way you shake your ass, I'm like ooh

But I swear to God
There's so many things I'd love to do to you
We can take it back to the crib

And I can give you, yeah, the biz
And you can show me what it is
I wanna see cause I give
Let my tongue be the bridge
Just imagine how that is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Qwote]
Heard you were a sucker, mama, for lollipops
Well if that's the truth then come to my candy shop
Got that chocolate factory open whenever
Let me introduce you to Mr. Willie Wonka
I can tell you know exactly what I'm talking about
If I go where you're licking your lips, staring down south
Finish up your drink and let's head out
Got a feeling you'll blow my brains out

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
I don't know your game, but it's magic
I like how it feels when we're dancing
Just let go, don't make it a challenge baby, yeah baby
So give me yours and girl I'll give you mine
Show me something for I spend some time
'Cause I got love I wanna make all night
With you baby, with you baby

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right

Now I'm back in the love alert
Laidback, open up, now it's my turn
Let me make sure that you feel right, feel good
Feel wet, feel freaky, feel nasty, feel wood
It's all good, we can keep it on the low, hush hush
I made it skate skate skate, no rush
We can make straight love or straight fuck
As long as EPT say no plus
(Lady)
Lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout you my baby
I've been thinkin' bout sexin' you crazy
I've been thinkin' 'bout doin' the things you shouldn't do
Like in a bathroom star with a car
On the dancefloor, over the bar
Or next time in L.A., pull over, get off, and you feel me right next to my Hollywood star
Play with it

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?

Think they won’t they will and they just die in the kill
Bowling, bad one, always behind me

That little chico Pitbull, Mr. 305
Used to live in every neighborhood in Miami
Putting it down with them tanners (hola)
Vedo-no Shake, what they do
Bang, welcome home
Demi, bet that up
Yessir
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Flaking the pot and watch it swim 90 miles, buddy
Vedo, Bang, Pitbull, it's all money
Grab the spatula
Pot racks and batch it up
Call him, bust that ass, niggas
Cause they still cashing up
It's more than Arm & Hammer
When them choppers cop
It's, it's bananas
Whipping up Carol City
Back it in Little Havana
Take it to Hotlanta
Then take it to Alabama
Where they do damage cause they
Breaking a nickel bag and they grabbing 'em
The Florida boys will squeeze the juice out of brick
To the point they'll even half-drop a hand, saying ""oh shit""
One time for them tanners (hola)
Two times for the crib (305)
Three times for my dawg Demi with a ten-year bid
I left the streets alone
Bang, welcome home
Demi gave me the word
Now it's time to get in on
Vedo, Pitbull and Bang
Hey yo, switch over rain
Them boys gon' do they thing
Welcome to Dade County man
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard

Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
[Vedo-no Shake]
Well if this money make it happen
Choppers clapping in your rearview
They talking cash with this mask, need a min or two?
Nine times outta ten
If he gon' rob, he gon' kill too
Pit gave the word, shot a bird
How it fell through
Now if you want it, want it, dawg
You can get it, get it
I do it for some change
Ain't no shame how she work with it
Twerk with it, lean with it, rock with it
Put it in a pack, make some g's on the block with it
Folds up, we got that fire brown
You can get yours right here
Start tripping if you wanna, boy
You can lose it right here
Yeah, right here, you can make it bubble up
X-man, ain't no question, I keep 'em doubled up
I'm from that south, south, with golds in my mouth, mouth
Representing my A, it ain't the same in a drought, drought
My homies don't fake, they call me No Shake
Prices going up, still got cake and it ain't my birthday

I deal with ho's, pounds, quarters
Can I take your order
Boatloads, crash the boat, in Florida
It ain't for 10 g's, that's only in Tennessee
Miami Heat just won, a brick done went for 23
Bang, call me Saddam in this land, the hood terrorist
Get soldiers with the bomb in their hands
Got grams, like extra ???, not Narcs, you stupid?
You can smoke it, sell it, fucking snort it or shoot it
Well if I even much think Imma snort it and shoot it
And bring the whole kitchen sink, how the army'll do it
But the truth is, we ain't tryna get the strap off
We'd rather save our shells and sell crack raw
Hold up, code they finna take it over with baking soda
If you ain't down with Vedo or Pitbull, you ain't a soldier
The dunes call it Coca-Cola, dreds call it coco nuts
Colombians, coco leaves, kids eat your Cocoa Puffs

Hard workers, I speak I'm proud to be
Our society's greedy, don't appreciate freedom
We should take 'em to Cuba and Haiti, let poverty greet them
So all my peoples in Cuba dreaming of freedom
Keep fighting them communists with God's help
I'ma fucking pay them

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they
Couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now
I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make
And what kind of car you in?
Seems as though you lost sight of
What's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

Ella se hace la bruta pa' cotizarse
Conmigo en frente, ella se hace la gata en celo contigo
Te cotorrea el oído pa' tenerte en alta
Ella muere por ti, tú por mí es que matas
Sigo tranquila como una paloma de e'quina
Mientras ella se pasa en su BM al lado mío
Yo de aquí no me voy, lo que está pa' mi

[Verse 1: Shakira]
She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, ""Ahh!"" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up

[Chorus: Shakira]
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal, Shakira]
That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica Caliente, got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good, and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, ""Ay, papi""

'Cause, we’re dancin' Mambo, oh, what she don't allow it?
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hit the- ooh!

[Intro: Pitbull]
For real, Shakira, Mr. Worldwide

[Verso 1: Shakira]
En la suite 16, lo que empieza no termina
Del mini bar al edén en muy mala compañía
Era ese sabor en tu piel a azufre revuelto con miel
Así que me llené de coraje y me fui a caminar por el lado salvaje
Pensé ""No me mires así, ya sé lo que quieres de mi""
Que no hay que ser vidente aquí
Para un mal como tú no hay un cuerpo que aguante

[Coro: Shakira]
Lo hecho está hecho, volví a tropezar
Con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
Y contigo nunca es suficiente
(Were in the mix driving her insane)

[Post-Coro: Pitbull]
Fooled me once, shame on you
Fooled me twice, shame on me
I can see it in your eyes that
You're wonderin' why you feel in love with me
El amor te confunde, el amor te ciega, el amor e todo
Y tu amor, ah, mi alma, me llega
I know you heard it all before
I know you seen it all before
Broken promises but I promise this time it's fo' sho

No hay ceguera peor que no querer mirar
Cuando te guardabas el anillo dentro del bolsillo y dejarlo pasar

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

[Verse 2: Jamie Drastik]
You don't choose to listen, I don't give forgiveness
We live in no recession, but I'm giving you the business
If you give me a check, I will never pay you digits
Check on debt when I pay your ass a visit
You walk with your nuts tucked, I let my shit hang
It's like I masturbate the way I do my own thing
I came on the game, first date, no name like motherfucking fame
Just avoid the shame, just avoid my lane
I guess what I'm saying, my mind's state on the top like mane
You say the game's your baby, I don't mean to do you trouble
But I'm spitting out abortions, so I guess I pushed your bubble
Check the lines I juggle, I don't wanna bum you
But I think you sound better If you were rapping with a muzzle
Oh, that's mean (mean), you should take that back
Not only will I not, but Pete asked you wack
Lights all rap, I clean up your act
Success just called and a bitch want me back
And who am I who a lot say I'm not still attached
'Cause the world's what if my mom were running laps
Put this shit to bed, put this shit to sleep
It starts in my head then I put the shit to beats
Foot soldiers so I'm stepping with my feet

Best foot foward don't the pen on the week
I depend on me, you can ask the engineer
I don't pen what I speak, life's a circle, folded half of three
I get nervous when good happens to me
'Cause I know bad's right around the corner
I look at Kurt Warner, land in Arizona
You went from the top to the bottom to the top
And the hardest thing to know is to know when to stop
They say I hit the rock but I'm on the incline
As long as I land as a man, I'm fine, I've done it their way
Now let's try mine, man, that work connect with the sign
I'm like the sunrise, I connect with the time
Cocaine flow walking neck with my lines
This the best action fine, I'm in no rush to sign
I'm in the rush full of right moves
I feel like Michael Jordan wearing light blue
Being scared of failure is was what I write to
I do the right thing but not as much as I like to
Smart kid but never had a high IQ
There's nothing that I can do within my own eye view
Grandma just passed last hour in a half
So I got another angel looking down on my behalf

[Bridge: Jamie Drastik]
So how can I be lost?
I'm am right on cause
Even if they shut my mic off
I think I said enough to recieve my applause
[Outro: DJ Delz]
Ah man, It's about that time
DJ Delz, Jamie Drastik, Pitbull

I'm about to end up calling it a night
She should holla at your girl, tell her that you're shaking the scene
Pulled off, beep beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, ""Ohhhh! I'm ready to ride""
(I was likе) Yeah
'Cause once you gеt inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound impatient but you gotta promise baby, oh!

[Chorus: Usher & Ludacris]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, I gotta know baby, oh yeah)

Sometime wanna be your lover, sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug you
Hold hands, slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart
'Cause you said I made you feel so comfortable

I could be your Bud, you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up
I do, anything just to feel yo' butt
Why you, got me so messed up?
I don't know but you gotta stop tripping
Be a good girl, now turn around and get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back, here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be setting separate plays
So on all these separate days, your legs can go they separate ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)

So i guess that's why i feel kinda ""stocky""
When guns pop they'll leave you like sloppy joe's
I fuck down bitches and i fuck sloppy hoes
She wanted me to fuck her brains out
So i stuck my dick through her nose

When she walked by, we locked eyes and she said ""Papi, what's up?""
I said ""Mami, where you going?"", she said ""Wherever you want""

And I was peepin' and watching a
And dreaming and rockin' that ass
And she was looking back at it and looking back like ""oh""
And I was looking straight at it, looking straight at it like ""woah""

Que le gusta bailar, que le gusta gozar
Que le gusta sin-sin-sin-sin, ya tú sabe'

I'ma take over this bitch, I promise
So get ready mothafuckaz, this is not a game
(Eee, yoo, uuu)

I'm from the dirty, dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed
With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng
Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it
Album shop it, it's all the same thang

Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
I look at these blue skies and think what a disguise
That's why it's called the Magic City, it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind

Word of advice, don't follow the streets, follow the signs
'Cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost
'Cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash and grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
You might also like'Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night?
They don't want you to stop 'cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear, yeah

Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty
Miami, we're dirty

Where they lace 'em, roll 'em
Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty
Guns they hold 'em
If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty

Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty
Miami, we're dirty

Where they lace 'em, roll 'em
Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty
Guns they hold 'em
If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty
Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact
Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
8 Gg's and Cadillacs, Chevys cut on the deltas
Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon' help ya

2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers
Vicious like silver back guerrillas, see then peel ya
Niggas down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
Serve ya, for ya or for ya
(Feel it)

You pussy niggas been hatin' on us for too long
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song
(That's whats up)
'Cause the time is now
(Now)
The place is here
(Here)

I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
So that when everything go down
It won't be no kind of surprise

And I got no time for yo lies
(No time for lies)
Save 'em for Peter
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater

Let's get it dirty
Everything we do is dirty

These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school Chevys
We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box Chevys
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
M I A M I till I die, 3 0 5

Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
'Cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors

So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches?
And niggas, cocaine cooking, brick flipping bitches, trippin' for figures
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it

This is for everybody in county, TGK
Metro West and Stockade doing time
And if you got more than 365
And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, that's right

Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty

Que me responda, que agarre la onda

Que se disponga, que no se me esconda

[Intro: Pitbull]
Desde Miami a Corea del Sur
MONSTA y Mr. Worldwide, vamos

[Coro]
No importa donde estés esta noche
Voy a volar por todo el mundo para encontrarte
Sé que podrías ser eso, dispuesta a montar
Sabes que dejaría océanos detrás de ti
Sentado en el jet, con una nube de humo
Deletreando tu nombre, para el cosmos
No importa donde estés esta noche
Me voy a asegurar de terminar a tu lado

[Verso 1]
Tengo un pasaporte, solo necesito un lugar, estoy dispuesto
Voy a estar ahí cuando despiertes a la mitad de la noche
Solo quiero ser el que llames
Que mi cuerpo sea la almohada en la que duermas
Puedo sentir a tu aura llamándome
Toda esta noche yendo atrás muy lento
Así que dime cómo alcanzarte, cómo tener mi cuerpo abajo de ti
Envíame tu ubicación así puedo ir y verte
Sé que estoy sin espacio
No puedo sacarlo de mi mente, sí
Tú eres dónde estoy destinado a estar, sí
¿Sabes?

[Verso 2: Pitbull]
Del uno al dos, del tres al cuatro, del cinco al seis
Del siete al ocho, sacudelo hasta que vibre
Uno de dos, tres de cuatro, cinco de seis
Siete de ocho, sacudelo hasta que vibre
Ella sabe que es mala, el jean lleno de culo
Quiero lo que ella tiene, quiero lo que ella tiene
Te veo siendo mala, bebé
Estoy todo en el corte, derramándolo
Rodando hacia arriba, sosteniéndolo
Importándome una ¿qué?
Si ruedas conmigo lo verás
¿Cómo se supone que esté?
No voy a mentir, como mis mujeres en tres
Quieres irte, quieres irte
Tú lo quieres todo, te mereces todo chica, porque bebé eres una estrella

[Verse]
I'm one of the best, one of the rawest
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
Barely made high school, the streets was my college
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
I've worked everything, every drug you name it
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment
Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen
Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen
Now it's cartoons and tv shows
First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores
I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind)

Have no business in music, what is this?
I learned from the best, stayed away from the worst
Now I send off every verse in a hearse
Now that every day is 15th and the 1st
No more food stamps; church
These boys can't get past third base
They a bunch of MC's searchin'
I can care less and you can give
A fat baby's ass if they car's got curtains
They rap for the block, I speak to the globe
I got them models, they holla at them hoes
Better do your homework, papito

Every block got crips, even schools got bloods
Everywhere got eses, eses
With the wrong colors hear, you shot like a dear
​This things getting messy, messy
Hes in a gang, shes in a gang
Pop up, show off your bang bang, bang
But I cry, cry, cry, for my generation
Only god knows!

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Here they come, y'all (x7)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Left from Morgan, Bushwick, Flatbush
Reason they call it Flatbush
Police come, get flat
​push the bush in the bush
​for nigga back and brains to get gushed
Thats the life in Brooklyn New York
Then I moved to Jersey where they still cause more spur
One chaca, two chaca, three chaca, four chaca
But your life worth more than that Ford Explorer
​Critics say this the secret to my longevity
I got many styles, many styles
For example this is the one and this is
​na, na, na, na, na me
Still got the swag and me me me mo me
Many wanna beat me
​but they can't copy copy copy copy(copy copy)
But they can only be one fugees
[?]
What we have will have my lighter on
My watch will blind the sun
And the Herb we smoke are from Solomon
But I cry, cry, cry for my generation!

I'm from Generation X, where we've dealt it all
From coke to the crack, crack to the x
Hero to the weed, weed to the meth
They talk like choppers, but they jam like techs
​Pits definitely one of the generation's best
​I'm watching everything round here go downhill
Cause everybody wanna be 2Pac
Every other two blocks, they've sold you rocks
Don't let these fool on TV fools you
Come here little man, let me school you!
Yeah, you see em with the money and the rims

So now, got the feds chase him
Hit him out of town

Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Pitbull]
All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time but
I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart is so cold to the point that my blood it froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby, you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex I'm sorry

Show her to the club where the bad ones do it
Line up the shots, throw it back, do it
Light it, throw it in the air, do it
You wanna take it off, baby, do it
In this party ain’t no social media
No camera phones, so let’s get it on
You can do what you wanna do
And do who you wanna do
Be what you wanna be
Freak who you wanna freak
Beep beep who got the keys to the suite?

And don't let anybody tell you can't do it

Pero mira Brother el dia que yo me valla del parque, no llores

Si vas a entregar el alma
Hazlo libre de temores
Si del amor mucho se aprende
Se aprende más de los errores, ay!

No llores, no llores, no llores, no llores
Deja de llorar, deja de llorar, deja de llorar
Ay! no llores, no, no que va
Deja de sufrir y suelta los temores
Ay, no llores

My legacy will live on the clouds will read 305
I learned from the wrong and did right
That's right, baby don't cry
When you look at me in that casket
Just know I lived my life the way I wanted
Just like you should live your life, the way you want
That's what life is about
You learned to live and live to learn

No llores por mí, sólo por mí
Si no disfrutas de la vida, nunca podrás ser feliz
No llores por mí, sólo por mí
Que la vida es muy corta, pa' seguir sufriendo así

Don't worry, girls, if he didn't notice you

Oye, mamita
Calmate, I feel ya

Those who survive are the ones that learn (Learn, learn)
If it don't kill ya, it makes you stronger
Pero no te ponga como una chonga
Even though I ain't gon' lie
It turns me on a little bit when you act like a bitch (Haha)
Mama, I know what you went through was hard
But the biggest bitch is karma, let her do her job (That's right)
Don't even stress these clowns
Baby, you a queen, here's the crown
Enjoy yourself, you independent now (That's right)
They lose, and you winnin' now (That's right)
You're a shootin' star
Now let 'em know who you are

[Chorus: Livvi Franc]
'Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to...
Can't get what you want, so you're acting like a punk
You were too fly then, so fly away now
Now I'm that bitch, and you're just a clown

Hot nuff more game then carmella

They tried to get rid of me
But from ocean to ocean
They gon' have to deal with me

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I been overlooked, slept on
Stepped on, left for dead
Always against all odds like Pac said
I'm the living Great Gatsby
But these boys are watching quick and disappear like Banksy
From ocean to ocean, sea to sea
I'm something that you gotta see

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I practice what I preach, but I ain't gon' lie
I still got love for these streets, 305 'til I die
Still got love for these beats, that's why I spit this fire
You can catch me on a beach, 'specially on the islands
Took over my city, now it's time for the world
I live it, they rap it, there's a difference, girl
Getting paid more than athletes, man, life is sweet
GM on the status, Papo, watch me, (Woo)

I got the world on my shoulder, still quick on my feet
Nas say sleep is the cousin of death so I don't sleep
These boys act like they hard but we know that they sweet
They wouldn't bust a grape at a food fight, Papo, please
Went from rapping with them boys with a mouth full of gold
To hanging with Slim Jr., down in Mexico
Take it with a grain of salt, and a, pound of gold
The game is to be sold, and not told, let's go

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

504 gangsta, New Orleans soldier
Bangin' underwater, fuck around and soak ya
Louisiana gunner, I'm 'bout my holster
And if you gettin' greasy, I'm an ulcer
I'm bickin' back, bein' bool, on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the beehive
Ain't nothin' sweet unless it's Presidential
'Cause that is where I sleep, now give me my key

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs (Yeah!), but I'm in the things
Save the colors for the cars, see, we kill for the fame (Ross!)
The boss made it, yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas (Ross!)
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller (Tell 'em)
Keep white in the office, call it Jerry Heller
Lettin' off a hundred rounds (Rounds), let the barrel pick (Pick)
And we gon' sit here and wait for the Darryl case

[Verse 3: Twista]
Chi got Lords and Gangsters, show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Sixes and Kings, show me where them killas at
Chi got them ballers and hustlers, show me where them figures at
Game, where them triggers at? Aim at them fitted caps
He got the clips, I got the scope, let's get them choppas, nigga!
He got the kush, I got the dope, let's get it poppin', nigga!
Hurt him in that cherry six-four, shit, ain't no stoppin', nigga
Hit him in the head and the body with a bullet
When I put him in the cemetery then I gotta holla out

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You knowin' my attitude shitty (Okay) only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smittys with me—shit, how many getting it?
(Hey, what you scared?) I'm prepared in the mall and all
With two-twos, you can call me Quick Draw McGraw (Haha!)
You try me, I'ma cut that fool, better call the law
I start sprayin', make fuck niggas fall and crawl (Bow! Bow!)
I press play like Puff, no pause at all
Choppin' holes in all the walls, that's all they saw, hey!

[Verse 5: Chamillionare]
I'm the realest youngsta that's breathin'
And I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competin' to be competin'
My purpose is to get the cheese
And that's a purpose that you're defeatin'
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet 'til I'm finished eatin'
My label tells me I'm greedy, hoggin' all the room on your TV
Like Eric, they think it's Eazy but it isn't easy, believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G
[Verse 6: Pitbull]
To all my Mexicans, que bola
I got y'all backs
I had lived through it and seen it all and that's a fact
To the new immigration laws they tryna pass
Tell the United States they can kiss my ass

From that number one Thug, it's still one love

I do it for my Folks, Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers, future rappers, standin' out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood, man, and stack up a knot
Put your sets in the air, scream, ""Fuck the cops!"" (Word, fuck 'em)
We gon' rep for the hood, man, like it or not (Thugga!)
[Verse 8: Young Dro]

Cars is improbable, I'm overcomin' obstacles (Okay)
Trappin', I made it logical (Okay), my topic is impossible (Okay)
I got a partner named Shoe Strang 'cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical (Yeah, yeah)
All guns choppable, all blocks are mobbable (Yeah, okay!)
I'm unstoppable, my Calico is toxable, lyrically diabolical
Kushin' is now cigarable (What it is!)

[Verse 9: Bun B]
I'm comin' straight up outta P-A-T like Compton in all black
But when we say ""What it do?"", they never say, ""Holla back!""
Bun Beeda, I'm OG, like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club off of Fairfax
Ask the Hundreds, it's doable, I done done it
At the summit of rap, and I'm watchin' you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it, to Bun, it don't differ
Wipe the streets with ya like you a Swiffer as a gift
One blood

I ain't see you in a while, baby girl
Tell me how you been and everytime I do see you
You and your friends are going in
Always at the bar looking so good with that devilish grin
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots (let the games begin)
We dancing and wе touching and we kissing and we bugging
She wanna show mе something, her tattoo below her stomach
And I don't think she's bluffing cause she put my hand to rub it
She said it's still all mine and I should hit it

But your hot I'mma make you dance
On the floor to the pole, baby, either way it goes
On the pole I'mma make you dance
On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop

Don't look back once we blast off, let's go

Dress me I'll handle the rest
We goin' in under the deck
Your body's under attack
One thing leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
Leads to another
If it ain't one thing, it's always another
Word to abuela papi my mother
That's why one thing always leads to another
Mamita, I'm raw like no rubber

Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me

Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me

I know we ain't seein' eye to eye, it just ain't workin'
You say you can't take no more, I know that we ain't perfect
I was tryna fix us up, you was up late night thirstin'
Goin' back and forth with you, nah, it ain't workin'

[Hook: Dougie F]
Left my phone unlocked that night, I did that shit on purpose
I ain't come back home last night, I did that shit on purpose

Yeah, yeah, on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose

[Verse 2: Dougie F]
Too much drink inside my cup, this can't be for one person
Too much weed inside my dutch, right now I'm high, I'm floatin'
Forgettin' all the times we had, our ups and downs, on purpose
I hope that you cry right now and no, no, I ain't jokin'
Why you play them games? I don't know, I do not know why
Scared if I ask you to tell the truth, you would sit there and tell a lie
I'm done up with all of your bullshit, I ain't gon' hold you back, go and fly

Mr. Worldwide
First letter of Cuba, is an open letter
So you know I had to do this
Let's start like this

[Verse 1]
Born in Miami, right on time
Scarface, El Mariel, Cuban crime
Admit it if you want to, truth is the truth, lie if you want to
Politics, yeah that's politic
Let's not act like half of our families ain't flipped bricks
We made Miami something from nothing
Let's not forget that we came from nothing
Los judios del caribe, ahora estan jodidos en el caribe
Blood is blood don't act like we anaemic
Elián got snatched back, the whole world seen it
Russian missile crisis had America skating on nuclear ice
Bay of Pigs big bluff
We thought they had our back, but they left us straight stuck
I ain't here to hold a grudge
I love the freedom that has been given to us
Now break down us, get it? U-S that's right god bless

[Hook x2]
Here's the freedom we ride for, here's the freedom we die for

Abuela y tía, Sierra Maestra, wich led to my mother in ""Pedro Pan""
In Cuba hit the lotto that means get your family search for freedom and run
Havanna made Vegas, ask Meyer Lansky
That's if you know where his grave is
Hermanos al Rescate, brothers to the rescue
Don't agree with the change Castro talk
But it's hard to understand unless they educate you
Politicians loves to hate you
But then they runaway when it's time to debate you
Question of the night, would they have mess with Mr. Carter if he was white?
Hm, rhyme with treasury
When way another in Cuba is where they'll bury me
Happy 5th year anniversary, Jay and B don't worry it's on me

[Hook]

A 1980 exodus of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dreams
A quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost
Boatloads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape, and hate
Entered this country through the bottom of the United States
And straight, set up shop
As Arthur McDuffy was being beaten to death by four white cops
This world was about to face the music
Between El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minority Americans
Could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it
Because in case y'all haven't noticed
We've gone from the El Mariel BOATLIFT
To the Hurricane Katrina buslift with the same response
With America standing to help us with one hand on their hips
And the other one on her guns
Like 9/11 somehow made us all Americans
But it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one
You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina
And the Oklahoma BOMBINGS, we all got something in common
And that's the desire to enjoy a freedom that cannot be rearranged by fear
To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here
So, TODAY, is 1980 again
And I'm that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy
Hope that when I spit this poem, the whole world will remember me
I'm screamin like Sincaid give us us us free, me, Pitbull, and this industry

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
It was midnight
I got the booty call
She said, ""I'm at the club""
So I threw on my drawers
I'm lookin' throwed in my fit, candy coat on my whip
The popos all on my tip, but man, I don't even trip
Sent me a dirty text
So I texted her back
Scooped up the Stooie boy, cause he had a purple sack
And now we gone with the wind, and so, we poppin' again
We rebel rockin' and rollin', this club is outta con-, outta con-
Uh, uh

Chorus: Baby Bash (Pitbull in background)
Outta control, she got me outta control (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She make you go crazy when she out of the floor (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Now I got one in the cage, and I got two on the stage
I got a waitress on the under, tryin' to give me some face
They play some Lil' Wayne

And now they playin' my song, the girls are showin' they thong

I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I seen my past life and politely passed
But I’m already planning on doin' it big
For my life after death and live my life after death
Baby, what you think all the training is for?
Just to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
If you look out for them friends that are really foes
This career tried to swallow us (Swallow us)
Paparazzi tried to follow us (Follow us)

Askin' me if I could get my hands on some vitamin E
And I was like mami hold on

Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please

Baby you're all that I want
(I don't believe in religion, I believe in god and baby you my heaven)
Baby you're all that I want
When you lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven
(She's my lady, my baby, my women and!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
She's hot as hell yeah, but she's my heaven
She is my Eve, I'm her apple for example
We got that simple passion
We got that hot lust
We got that one in a million love
All of the abovе, let them talk they еnvy
I love them text's you send me, with a pic attached
Your girlfriend she friendly
You like a quarterback, your going down in the sack
Our love is never ending
That's why they hate like that

[Hook: Nayer]
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe, we're in heaven
And loving is all that I need
And it found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
(She's my lady my baby my women and!)

She's there thick and thin
She's there rain or fall
She's there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall
She's with me whether we live, life is beyond poverty
She loves me for me

This life can be deceitful
In my career attracts
All the wrong people
If you find a keeper
Then you better keep her
I always put her first
Her love is heaven on earth

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe, we're in heaven

Baby your all that I want

From Dade to Decatur
Only difference is y'all blow dro
And we blow crip
But reall there's is no difference
'Cause they're both green and sticky

'3 0 5Ã¢?Â para arriba sin formar intriga
Preguntale a Ralphy Pagan si yo le dije que Dime
Featuring Ken-Y iba ser un paro
Preguntale a Zion quien era el primero buscando la cadena
Que le tumbaron en el video de Julio Voltio en Miami
Right by Brown Sub
Dile A Los Latin Grammys Pitbull Don't Give a Fuck
No estoy amenazando esto no es tiradera
Esto es la verdad y te lo juro por la reina Celia
Papo esto es serio Pitbull genial convence el mercado Latino
Sal de en medio

[Chorus]
Le gustan las prendas le gustan los diamantes le gustan las cadenas
(Cada loco con su tema)
Aqui ya llego artistas mal agradecidos pero diario se queman
(Cada loco con su tema)
No crean lo que oigan no crean lo que vean y miren lo que lean
(Cada loco con su tema)
Dios siempre pone la verdad pa' que todos la vean
(Cada loco con su tema)
Preguntale a Don Omar that my peoples cuando
El tenia corte en Puerto Rico
Nosotros estabamos en un show en Nueva York
La noche anterior y yo le dije dale tira primero y coje el vuelo
Preguntale a Echo si no es verdad todo lo que me a pedido yo lo hecho

Preguntale a Chingo Bling quien estaba ayi afuera
Buscandole el negocio del Corazon sin feria
Preguntale a Fat Joe quien es el unico que paga respeto
Para la gente que abrieron las puertas
Felicidades Calle 13 con los Grammys
Juegan lo que juegan eso no se juega en Miami
No estoy amenazando esto no es tiradera
Esto es la verdad y te lo juro por la reina Celia

(Umm... Umm... Umm... Umm...)
Anjuli Stars... Pitbull...
This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life
Don't worry they in a better place now

[Verse 1: Anjuli Stars]
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life with out you
Every hour is solemn I need you
I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do
There is so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside
Watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky
It's burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke
I wish I could float far away from here

[Hook: Anjuli Stars]
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, Washing me away
Washing me away, Washing me away

Still dealing' with the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you
I ain't cry when you died
But i'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother Uly just came home
And it feels good to have him back
Welcome home dog
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you have till it's gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing
And the words of this song
Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla
But I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know you both looking down on me proudly
I know ya'll both love me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
See in Life things go wrong
If it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then there is something wrong
Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is
That's why I thank God any chance that I get
For blessing me with beautiful kids
What's victory with no loss
What's smiling with no tears
What's love with no hate
What's courage with no fear
Just think about it , and apply it to your life
And no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby
Keep your head up it's gonna be alright

Blueberry I put you down, 38 might get you a pound

And 33 get a bitch shot down
Come down to overtown
Where them boys roll with a 4 pound
And and 4-5 with a deuce-deuce

To the ones that push keys
To the ones that push petty rocks
If you pull off that, then I pull it pop
Lemme show how them boys down here roll
They know how to cook a yellow slab
To match their mouth with yellow gold
No job's a handful of work
And the bitches down here work poles
These bootlegers pimp harder
They niggas they the ones that work hoes

From pools to C-C-O-T to OP, Windwood, to AP
Them boys up pull up in the van, jump out like the A-Team
And they love, and they love to spray things
Let's not talk about the night
Cause this just a motherfucking day thing
Welcome to the bottom, we call it the crib

Keep it one hundred and one, man don't be fucking around
Cause in my side of the city, pretty shit don't live
Nice shit don't exist, and ain't no love to give
What you want out of this life you gots to go out and take it
Cause they ain't giving one no opportunities to make it
You come in this world naked, and mama can dress you
But sooner or later, you come out and deal with the pressure
There are niggas that you've lost only to not return
So whatever you've earned, protect it, or burn

I spit it the best like pregnant pussy
Stand on the ledge and they're there to push me
I'm over the top, i'm over those fully automatics
I'm over the Glock, bitches like ""uh ah Pit is hot""
I on the track or I in her asshole
Or ah when i pull out and let that nuts splash her
Like Mike ""Peosa"" Pitbull will catch you
Niggers wanna hurt me cuz i spread like herpes
Contagious with the flow... Danger! hit the floor
One in the chamber, oh and there's plenty more
But that just came from jaw just they ain't ready for
The serious; seriously you're gonna die
And like a coward no more that you ain't ready to ride
I'm tryin' to get ready you guys
Fuck youre family ties
Over an onion these niggas'll make you really cry

Today is gonna be the day that
They're gonna throw it back to you and by now
You should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 1: Jamie Drastik]
They tell me to not mention my life or my kid in my interviews
It's image-driven and they wanna give a different view
I tell them go to hell, go and meet Satan
Something like that, I may be paraphrasing
They don't understand how much I am a soldier
Recording in the booth with my son up on my shoulder
Telling him to stay away from this money's older
Yeah, thе war is cold, but the music biz is colder
I'm just trying to give thеm better hope
Fuck a chain, I'd rather see them with a telescope
The corniest shit I did was start selling coke
Especially to my friends, what a fucking joke
I got glass on my knuckles for the bloodsport
You take a shortcut, you getting cut short
I'm in the baddest box, full count three and two
But I'ma hit it out the park, I'm retrieveable

Man, I drink white piss, yellow made green
I did it big and just to think it was all a dream
Never thought when I was protecting my neck out for the cream
Came a long way from a snot-nosed and shit stain
Little cuban boy grew up thinking crime phase
I saw it all, even those were my blind days
I though I knew it all but I ain't know shit
You heard such and such, went to prison, no shit
You heard such and such, got killed, no shit
This what my life became and I was like, oh shit
I was going down, speeding in the school zone
I need to slow it down before I blow it now
Turned my life around, now I'm world renowned
Every stage I touch, I tear it down
Now you can YouTube and see who is who
150 million views, dawg
Who they who?

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
Look, an opportunity comes once in a lifetime
I'm not a pussy so I don't rely on nine lives
I'ma claw to the top when I fly by
But the odds stacked against me, white lie
Say that life's a ride, but I can't enjoy it
Mental rollercoaster, who got the stomach flu?
You should pay attention, how can you not afford it?
Life is my ghost writer, how could I not record it?
Success is up the road, I think I'm near it
I used my freedom of speech and charge people to hear it
This a sample of my talent, no charge to clear it
I'm on my own ride, no one's hear to steer it
Until they put me in the sky, respect me from the ground up
Regulator or hater and tell my team to mount up
Let 'em talk crazy, I could care less
You ain't run this shit, you a fix-it

[Coro: Pitbull & IAmChino]
No se que pasó ayer (I don't know)
Cuando yo te conocí (When I met you)
En la cama yo me desperté (Then I woke up)
And you were naked next to me (Butt naked)
Entonces yo me pregunte (Then I asked myself)
Qué es lo que pasó aquí? (What happened?)
Lo único que yo sé (But this much I know)
Borracho yo se la ví
Borracho yo se la ví

[Verso 1: Pitbull]
Mami, tu estás rica
Dale, ven pa' acá muñequita
Vamos a tomarnos unos tragos
Y después ya tu sabes pa' abajo
Tu eres mala, yo soy malo
But we both like it
The kissing, the licking, the biting
Then we fuck like we're fighting
Ain't that exciting?

[Pre-Coro: Pitbull]
Loca
Tomando un trago a la' roca'
Mami, tu si estás loca

Rolling it up, holding it up
Ain't that thang swollen or what?

We gon' take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be, that makes me too live for your crew
Oh, get down, get low

Let's ride, let's go
Get loose, get crunk, get drunk, get blown

Show them tig ol' bitties like girls gone wild
Take off your dancing clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down the yellow brick road
Where brothers go to see her come out they clothes
Shake that thang, girl
And be off in the club makin' it hard
Then drop like this (Drop like this)
If you wanna make the money, shawty, work that (Work that)
Put a hump in your back and lift it raw
To a three point stance, with yo' flexible self

Yeah, we break it down, better shake a booty, girls
And the girls in the club with the real tight clothes
One time for your mind on the Ying Yang Twins
You already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talkin'
Girl, you can get the walkin'
Patrollers, where I'm groaking
The only way that we gon' talk
If yo' breath smell like mine
Girl, don't care, 'cause you fine
I diss 'em 'fore I kiss 'em
I pack 'em 'fore I stack 'em
So, while we in the club, better get these girls

Fresh off of the crash
Freshen up tail like an old mouse trap
Tell me what it is, how the 88 sound
I'm gonna take you to my crib for a lil' night cap

But then the slap, ghetto clown
Tap, tap, tap to the pretty little gal
Pump and burn to Knicca

Wanna touch, even wanna cut
Down there like a butt
Black and white, mixed like a mutt

I'mma pimp walking with a limp
Got a twelve inch in my pants
I've got her in a clip held by a chimp
I'm the man when it come to this

I prefer a lift of my chopsticks
Oh stop it
Let the dancer take money outta your pocket
She can move it and drop it
With her clothes on, it makes her topless
She a hot girl in her own world
On the spot, girl
Body tease, body all grease like a S curl
My dizzies get my face made kinda sleazy
Pop it, shake that thang girl, please me

I like cars with the candy paint
And an iced out booty with an iced out make

I like girls with their goodie-good-good
Woodpeckers peckin' on the woodie-wood-wood
She love a go on the hoodie-hood-hood
Takin' the whole thing like I knew she could

Tell me what you've been drinking
I can tell what you're thinking
That I'll be yours for the weekend
Honey, I gotta do it my way so
Don't rush, don't rush
Just lay low
But be ready when I say go

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Jade]
If you just want one hit
I guarantee you'll miss
Because my heart and this
They go together
If all you want is fun
Then after that you're done

I wanna take a little nibble or maybe a full bite
And make a full night, I roll dice and gamble

Me, I'm all ears unlike Vincent Van Gough
So tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Tell me what you like and I'll do it, do it right
Me, I'm 'bout my business
No, I'm not the mob
But your boy got a hit list
My life's my trial
Jehovah's my witness
Rewind it a couple of times
And maybe you'll get this
You need a man in your life
Them boys that you're playin' with
Ain't doing you right
Two times, say it twice

You were there through the pain
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived
I guess it's true what they say, love is blind
We together till the day that we die
Until death do us part
Baby you my heart
They can take all the houses and the cars
But they'll never take my shooting star
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Verse 3: David Rush]
Now as I lay her down to sleep
Pray my Lord this girl I keep
Usually, by now I would've went and creep
With a P.Y.T. that I met last week
But it's something about this one
That make me not have to go get none
Ask her what I need and it goes get done
And the same thing back so it makes us one
So every morning when I roll over
Pray that she's there on my arm and shoulder
And I can be her blanket when the world gets colder
Watch me make her, watch me mold her
She got me open like my doors and drawers
Heart beats fast like I stole a car
I never thought it would go this far
Tonight I wish on a shooting star
(Star, star, star)
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star

But I'm trying to figure out from where you came
Because a star like hers
Man, it really occurs in a world like this
Only way you ever meet a girl like this
Get up in a spaceship and take that trip
We kinda have a way with words
We even start a convo' to get at her
Every other [?] becomes a blur (Shake that)
Be my misses, I'll be your sir
I love her, the way she is

This night the time we've got
That's all we do with the time we've got
And I don't want to miss a thing
So come over here little miss stain
Y no dejes que la vida te viva
Y vive la vida me entiendes
Yo he ganado poco, he perdido mucho
Yo entiendo lo que sientes
Palante' y parriba'
Yo siempre lo digo porque eso es la vida
De nada algo yo soy el ejemplo, yo soy la guia
El que ama sufre, el que sufre lucha, el que lucha gana, dale mi hermana
Sana sana culito de rana, si no sana hoy, sana maana...

[Beatriz Luengo]
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing... (Let's go)

Hey girl

I'm celebrity faced and on top of the speaker
Drinks up, looking for a celebrity streaker
Let em off, shawty
I'll throw your rings up like Kobe
You an all star, show me
You can never be my one and only
But if you're sexy
I'll make sure you don't go home lonely
Club lights, flash from them bottles
Tryna get lucky like lotto
Give it to you, pass out, that's the motto
Full throttle, just saying
When you ain't looking, I saw you
Don't bother with the I ain't never did this before
This cheap, I've seen you do it all last week
Between this club, at this town
Better get yours before I get mine
[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
You can buy the club, but I own it
No more shots for her, cause she's on it
And by the end of the night
Imma have her and her friend
My tongue done be on it
Habla mucho, pero no tiene conjo
What I look like, fighting these mojons
Not me, I'm going to the next country
Getting more more more dough
Pits hit more chicks than you can fathom
You ain't gotta take them, you can have them
I'm a savage, I'm hit em all day
But my tongue is what grabs them
Just imagine this when you get all fat
Prrrrrrr, she came twice, I came last
You know the rest, roll the grass

[Pre-Hook+Hook]

Eu vou mostrar pra tu o que é bom
Vem garota, vem curtir meu som
Eu só quero passar um tempo contigo
Eu só quero prazer...

(PitBull)

To viajando, chapando, pensando em você
Bebi pra te esquecer e fiquei na deprê.        x2

Me diga o que você quer
Se quer sair pra farra ou ficar do meu lado
Não me faça de bobo
Meu vulgo é Pitbull
E eu não sou abestalhado

Não vou entrar no seu jogo
Porque eu não sou seu capacho
Se você me iludir
Eu atiro em outra e te deixo de lado

Brabo
Você é minha pequena
E eu o seu namorado
E você me hipnotiza com seu rebolado
Mas cê sabe que eu sou safado
E tô sem um real no bolso
Você me puxa e fala ""vem moço""
Eu vou contigo e beijo seu pescoço

Meu pecado capital
Ela diz que ta bem, mas eu sei que tá mal
Ela gosta assim
Porquê mesmo sofrendo ela gosta de mim
Meu pecado capital
Ela fala que não mas tá tudo normal
Eu ja vejo o fim
Ela diz que me ama sorrindo pra mim

Minha vida é final de semana
A gente tem tudo só falta a grana
E ela mete o loco comigo tambem
É só duvidar, disposição a gente tem

Tão linda no espelho arrumando cabelo e com três conto na mão
Já tá despreocupada já anda comigo, vamo de busão
É domingo a tarde tamo indo no porto pegar insolação
Essa mina é perigo, ela cola comigo sai da frente irmão

Não importa o que pensam, o que importa é o que eu faço e eu já tenho fé
Ela ta me pedindo, ela quer meu abrigo, quer ser minha mulher
Me chama de preto e solta o cabelo começa a dançar
E fica louca e beija minha boca ela que me usar
Ela quer me usar... Ela quer me usar... Me usa
(Jorgito)
Eu gosto de mulher independente
Mulher que é envolvente
Aquelas que deixam na mente
Que não precisam de um demente
Eu sou desse jeito, nem certo e nem errado
Sou verdadeiro, romantico, esperto
A mistura de tudo, pra tá do seu lado
Viaja no meu crash, não pense que é irônia
Eu querer viver um amor, no século da putaria
O vinho do meu coração
Ainda possui umas gotas
Será que seria loucura minha
Te encher do meu álcool garota?

Sei que viaja em mim
Só fala de mim
Tá pensando em mim
Em ligar pra mim
E fica louca só de olhar pra mim
Então porra, para de negar pra mim
Quantas bocas você vai beijar
Pra depois perceber que ninguém toma o meu lugar
Pode anotar, paciência tem limite
E eu não vou te esperar
O problema de tudo é que cê errou
Não quer admitir que virei teu amor
No contato meu nome você já mudou
Brota na minha house
Que nós faz amor
Refrão (2x)
Eu vou mostrar pra tu o que é bom
Vem garota, vem curtir meu som
Eu só quero passar um tempo contigo
Eu só quero prazer...4Embed"
Pitbull,So Sorry by Pitbull,3787355,So Sorry,So Sorry,https://genius.com/Pitbull-so-sorry-lyrics,[],Pitbull,"6 ContributorsSo Sorry Lyrics[Intro:]
Wake up, motherfuckers!
And smell the Cuban coffee
Una coladita, ha, ha, ha
You ain't gotta worry about MIAMI being represented no more
'Cause it gets represented thoroughly throughout the world
By who? By yours truly
Mr. From nothing something, Let's ride

[Verse:]
I'm here now, alive in the flesh
Burning shit down like David Koresh
Except Imma walk out and wave bye to the press
Yes, you heard me correct
Pit's like the I-R-S, I'm here to collect
On taxes that bitch life owes me
Now it's time to pay back
It's either that or run in some cribs
Strapped with the K
Asking, where them K's at
I flow special, like that K
All my smokers, light that J
If you think you're that hot, hell's right this way
I see you took the first step
You already pressed play, and
That there impressed me
And I'm truly flattered, I'm truly thankful
Money I'm not worried about
Cause Imma have a bank full
I'm not trying to brag, I'm not trying to floss
But it's hard to find yourself living
In the land of the laws
A lot of these cats would sell their souls to the devil
No matter the cost, for a piece of success
Not knowing the consequences, and the constant tentions
I'm a monster playing, monster's ball
When I'm telling y'all, I'm on, ready for it all (RRR-all)

Just wanna dance all night 'til it hurts
But you make me say ooh, damn
Cause I, I can't find the words

[Chorus: Mike Taylor]
You stole my heart, we had a summer fling
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June to December, it was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
That it was just a summer thing

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Maybe I'm feeling you a little bit too much
But I like the way you feel and you touch
And I like the way you kiss and you cuss
And I love that it's not love, it's lust
Now baby, sit back and relax and think about the man that you're with
I went from the block to the jet to the yacht
And from being 'round keys to a house in the Keys
[?] I got aim where they're not
I aim where they wanna be
It's been like this since I handled the rock
I'm a seasoned vet
And when it comes to women, I try to please 'em best
I'm not a player, baby, I just love sex
Now let's get into these freaky other things
And make this a wonderful summer thing

Deer in the headlights, dancin' like she's in a movie scene
To die for, and it's killin' me

And I'm so close to heaven

Takin' shots for the soldiers in the field
Thanks for the freedom, and that's for real

I jump on the track, drop the bass
And I ain't talkin' 'bout crack
I was born in a era, where Michael Jackson
Was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
And when it came to drugs
Miami would always stand and deliver
Welcome to the 80s
Ladies and gentlemen
I took over the radio, I took over the clubs

(Olá, olá!)
¡Hola, Miami!
Let's go!
You might also like[""She Wolf"": Shakira]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
Let it out so it can breathe

[""Empire"": Shakira]
Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like, and I'm like, and I'm like
And I'm like
And I'm like
And I'm like
[Transition sampling ""Kashmir"" by Led Zeppelin]
[""Ojos Así"": Shakira]
Ayer conocí un cielo sin sol
Y un hombre sin suelo
[Belly dancing transition, playing ""Move"" by Said Mrad]
[""Whenever, Wherever"": Shakira]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence

Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear
[""I Like It"": Shakira]
Yeah, baby
(I like it like that)
I like it, like it
(I said I like it like)
Yeah
(I said I like it like that)
¡En Barranquilla me quedó yo!
(I said I like it)
[Bad Bunny, Shakira, Both]
Chambean, chambean, pero no jalan (¡Jalan!)
Tú compras to'a las Jordan, bo, a mí me las regalan
I spend in the club what you have in the bank
This is the new religion bang in Latino gang, gang, ¡yeh!
Trato de hacer dieta, pero es que en el closet tengo mucha grasa (Uh!)
Ya mudé la' Gucci pa' dentro de casa, yeh
Cabrón, a ti no te conocen ni en Plaza
El Diablo me llama, pero Jesucristo me abraza
Guerrero como Eddie, que viva la raza, yeh

[Transition: Shakira with Bad Bunny]
I like it like that
Oh yeah, I like it like that
[Mashup ""Chantaje"" / ""Callaíta"": Shakira & Bad Bunny]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es
Ella no era así, ella no era así
No sé quién la dañó
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
[""Hips Don't Lie"": Shakira]
No fighting!
No fighting!
C'mon, gimme that
(Shakira, Shakira)

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight
!Vamos, Miami!
I'm on tonight
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air, c'mon
(I'm on tonight)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Shakira does the zaghrouta]

[Mapalé dance transition]

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection
They know I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? This is perfection

No fighting!
¡Y gracias!

[Transition: Jennifer Lopez]
Miami, are you ready?

[""Jenny from the Block"": Jennifer Lopez]

(Everyone's got to make a living
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block)

From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J.Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don’t hate on me
What you get is what you see (Southside Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go

We’re from the Bronx, New York

[""Ain’t It Funny (Murder Remix)"": Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy

[""Get Right"": Jennifer Lopez]
Huh, let’s get it!

You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
(Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

('m about to sign you up)
We can get right
(Before the night is up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
We can get right
(I'm about to fill your cup)
We can get right
(Before the night is up)

Sing!
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah)

You got me?
We can get
We can get
We can get

Sing high-igh-igh
Say ah-ah-ah
Oh, yeah

We can get
We can get
We can get right, oh

[Waiting for Tonight: Jennifer Lopez]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight (Oh)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
(Waiting for tonight)

Let me introduce you to my party people in the club

If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor

It's Kamikaze when I got a thumper, cause Twista ride
Ever since the days that I was spittin suicide
Push your crew aside, every year I cop the newer ride
Still in the streets even though I was po-pimpin with Do or Die
But nigga, use a lie, you said you runnin things
You say you the man on the land with the work
And you got that money, man
You say you could hold yo business
Talk about you be holdin heat
But the word I hear is that you'se a hoe in the streets
Nigga where yo chief, nigga where yo gov?
Can you tell me who yo Jeffe, motherfucker, where yo guns?
Better tell me what hood yo from and where you servin at
Do the homies that be holdin things down
Over hear know you servin that?
Jeffrey Matter don't know ya, K-Town ain't heard of ya

(verse 1)
Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That i was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go

But Im gonna keep on trying

How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby

Nine to Five to stay alive
What is that? What the fuck is that?!

[Action Bronson]
Don't hurt me again (no, uh)
Don't hurt me again (no, no)
Don't hurt me again (no, no)
Don't hurt me again, baby

[The Alchemist]
Listen, listen, listen

We will be here forever. Do you understand? For ever!
For ever and ever, and ever and ever

{MF DOOM}
Tried to outrun ‘er
The chikungunya had 'em leg-locked
Stung, slipping out of bed-cot
Head hot, ready not
Wait a cotton-pickin’ minute, carver bitten by a black widow
Why bother? Shouda rid ‘er as a larva
Starved her inner system like the best tape ate up
Under pressure like under investigation straight up
No chaser, ask for it like the victim
First time she kissed him was the worst time she dissed him
Bet your bottom wad of Washingtons, would'a squashed it then
Now he’s like a hostage in the box, needing oxygen
Breathe it in, came up out the swamp lands
Conquered fans, clap your feet, stomp your hands
Loose cannon, wasn’t wrapped too tight, hair trigger
A tendency to bust at the slightest tap, yeah nigga
Just don’t drop her, live round size nine
Sometimes a mind of her own, sometimes a hive mind
Thuggin’, screamin', “Fug the police”
With they brain on bugs in a hot pan with no grease
Keep your toes crossed, clothes off, rose quartz, so warm
Yet still so cold, so froze warts
[?] soon as she step foot
All hail the Queen like [?] that of Hatshepsut
Met her eyes, showed her what the trick was
Sure to satisfy with more nuts than a Snickers does
Love is a battlefield, scarred like Benatar
It’s all fair in lust and war ma, ven aca
Caught up in the crossfire like Binaca blast
Cockblockers hatin' like it’s not gonna last
He's just a gigolo like Lee Roth from the tee-off
‘Til she brought a blade to his [?] squeeze soft
Cursed be the gin
Be sure to bring the juice, lord, they thirsty as sin
If this is the end, she worked at a ten
Remember when we was just friends, then
Between the sheets
Splash the beat, squirt skeet with the pen
See 'em in the streets

Only hope to contain unless if you know 'em

Mami got that top off, mami got that low ride
Mami got that big trunk, wet paint, that right
Mami got that get down, she got that lock jaw
She got that slip, she got that slide, she got that Pacquiao
Mami's a knockout and that's for real
Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill
Mami's a knockout and that's for real
Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I-I-I don't wanna waste your time
Big girls don't cry wolf when they cry
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight
Yeah we might fall in love tonight
I-I-I don't wanna waste your time
Pretty girls always tell pretty lies
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight

Ain't got cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her

Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes
That's why I'm grinding till i die

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
A superstar I am, I haven't dropped the classic
No illmatic, it was written, or I am
Honest to the public, that I am
Mr. 305, that I am
A rapper I'm not, perhaps that's you
A hater I'm not, perhaps that's you
Signed a fucked up deal, perhaps that's true
But I owe my publishing, unlike you
If you would look past, all my hits
Notice when I say, all my hits
Pits got a track record unlike them
Money made me see my enemies
Were really just my friends
They ride in the beginning, but not to the end
Money's what you got, not what you spend
Listen to this verse here closely
These boys off like butter
But they still wanna toast me
Put your hands up nice and slowly
This's a stick up, now give me what you owe me
TVT, now you know what it is
Imma make your name worldwide
For not paying us... shit!

Get you three strikes that's right, then they out yo
I hear you take keys, but I doubt y'all
They talk weight when it's really like 8- balls
Just like powder, uh, yeah they soft
Off the coke like ross, then that's how they cake y'all
Treat you like a git, make you take your J's off
Hit you all night and make you take all your days off
Everyday a different day in every state
Different city, till you're caged in, never late
A life of a hustler, a real street boy
With a chopper, I'm street sweet boys
It happens too often down in, Dade county
Story of my life, but I stay grounded
These fuckboys wanna play, but they stay grounded
Allergic to paper, that's why they, not around me

I love the paper, damn I'm such an addict
I'm might have stumbled, but still kept my balance
With such a fame got me going harder than Cialis
Its difficult for y'all, but to me, it ain't a challenge
The saying that they like me, that's so unlikely
Hustle all day, Trazz grind til they invite me
Try to pull back, but the game still excite me
I'm rolling like Gucci, so yeah bitch I might be
See I'm a president, I think it's evident
You only here overnight, I'm a resident
I'm blessed with it, niggas say the flow heaven sent
So fuck the fame, I can let the paper represent
I'm on my grind, but it's far from the greed
Money in my blood, so it's worth it when I bleed
These rappers all frail, they crumble like blue cheese
So believe me, it's all motivation like Jeezy

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago

But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Oooh! I want the time of my life
Oh baby, ooh...
Give me the time of my life
Eh, eh, eh

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, line up some shots
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said, ""Yes""
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust

Forget about bills and the first of the month

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'll ride or die for me
I can see right through your eyes
And I know what you're tryin' to do
You're tryin' to rob, steal, take my love; well, fuck you
Take my love? (Hahaha)
Not a woman on earth that can do that, say what?
I don't know where you're from or where you been at
I'm lettin' you know what's up
And if you don't play by the rules, baby, you get caught
I talked so much, she took my love, fuck

Yo, I'm in the club and the place is poppin'
Sip-sippin' bub' and the bass is knockin'
Times are great 'cause I'm with my crew
But my smile's fake 'cause I'm missin' you
Baby, you know that I done learned my lesson
Should've gave you more time, more love, and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep tellin' myself a player ain't supposed to cry

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one

(Rusher!)
She took my love and played for a sucker
But it don't even matter 'cause you know I still love her
She took my heart and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter 'cause I still want her around
She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart-breaker
But a great love maker, all in the sheets
She made my heart skip a beat
But for now, she's as cold as they come
No match, no knife, and no gun: she took my love

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps tellin' me you're the one

They thought it was done dawg
But he's back bigger, better, stronger, and free
Like I ain't fought my way off these motherfucking situations
Trust this

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot
Mr. 305, no label stay hot
38 choppers, but please, no Glock
Used to move work, but had no trap, no block, no spot
Ma was cool with the work, but no rocks
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag
Said, ""I had enough of this shit with your dad""
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad
I was out to my first baby mama's crib
Caught her fuckin' round, off to abuela's crib
Thank God for music my savior
That's what helped me fight Xavier
Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa
Shit, better say it
I am an owner, bitch

And I see you standin' there
Not an ordinary night
Feeling lust is in the air (hey)

Its turnin' me on
They way you lick your lips slow
Makes me want you even more

[Chorus]
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh

Could this be wrong
To feel this way
And come on so strong

Don't know your name
But your turnin' me on

Love to hate me
I love that you hate me greatly
I appreciate your love

[Verse 1: RJ]
If you want me now
Celebrate the love that we have inside
Like a full moon rise
Right here into my arms
Every day I feel I can live or die
If you realize
When you walk right out my life
I don't wanna lose the fight
But I can't seem to forget you
Even though we're through

[Pre-Hook: RJ]
You know it ain't love, oh oh oh
Why am I lost without your touch
You know it ain't love, oh oh oh
Cause this feeling is too much
You know it ain't love

[Hook 1: Pitbull]
Uh, yeah
Mami raps right
So I pulled out my dick and told her to
Speak into the mic
You love me, you hate me
To those that love to hate me
I love that you hate me greatly
I appreciate your love
You can throw me in a blender
But y'all can't cheat, uh!

*You know it ain't love
You know it ain't love
Cause when you open up inside
I can't keep you from my eyes
You know it ain't love*

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I've been politically incorrect
Since the day I was born
That's why 'til the day that I die it's on...
Imma fight for the cause
When the pit bites
You know what happens to the jaw
Fuck around and it might be your
Big L, Big Pun, B.I.G, and Pac

[Verse 3: RJ]
Why are you so bad
This means a heart that burns the fire
Can make us higher
You just make me feel sad
This was the best thing I could ever have
That's the word you said
I was wrong I did not tell you
When I needed you
Set me free, why me
But I can't seem to stop dreaming
With all these demons
[Pre-Hook: RJ]
You know it ain't love, oh oh oh
Why am I lost without your touch
You know it ain't love, oh oh oh
Cause this feeling is too much
You know it ain't love

[Hook 2: Pitbull]
Chances are one in a million
Aaliyah died in a plane crash
So I guess that makes her one in a million
May you rest in peace
But that's your job
Destiny is somethin' that you just can't cheat
If you're destined to die
It's just your time, live with it
You don't think y'all got that line (uh!)

[Post-Hook 2: RJ]
*You know it ain't love
No baby
You know it ain't love

I can't keep you from my eyes*

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

It's like the whole world just turned down
Your body's all I hear
Admiring your sound
It plays so loud and clear

Who's that chico with them block boys on the benz?

But me, I'm from the home of the sins, Dade County
Baby, you the one that I want
The one that I'm watching, pencil skirt
High heels and stockings and it got me going crazy
Like 'ooh-baby, baby, baby'

And I'm hoping that gonna get down and dirty too
It's way too strong
Leave your friends alone and let's go, come on

Fall in line season has officialy begun
So for everyone that got a lot of shit to say
Shut the fuck up and fall in line
It's DJ Noodles, DJ Buddha, and Pitbull
Congrats homie, I know you a free agent now
I think it's time we go in on them
Fix your face, Let's go

[Hook 1: Pitbull (DJ Noodles)]
Pit's loco: for no,no
But he always rolls with like 18 hoes
I'm tired of these boys with their raps
About jets, about coke, about crack, about smack
Little buddy here's the facts

When it comes to the ride, they there first to bitch
When they see them feds 'round they the first to snitch
When they get that money, they the first to snitch
And if you blow first aid, they the first to talk shit

Pit's loco: for no,no
But he always rolls with like 18 hoes
I'm tired of these boys with their raps
About jets, about coke, about crack, about smack

I learned not to trust, not to care
Me I just breathe, and I'm taking they air
Me I don't talk, I don't have time to share
They can walk it out but they going nowhere
I see em like kids: I don't hit em, I spank em
They try to oversee me, me I'm overseas banking
They still in the hood with the coke and weed stinking
Do yourself a favor, don't get Abraham Lincoln

See them haters in the club asking what they drinking
Look them in the eye, you can tell what they thinking
They think that they Pit's cuz they got a ring on they pinky
And stretch a lil' coke like slinky, Please!

My nights are getting shorter, my nights are getting longer
I'm on the road, moving quietly, getting stronger
My prime game is, hard to describe
I can feel the Envy, I can feel the hate, I can feel your body
You can feel, that you feel, that I'm always something'
Yeah right, that when the things go to jumping in the cage
Used to ripping in that moss, word goes the pumping
Your boys rappin' say a whole lot of nothing
Im like that, to coke in water
When you'll think I dissolve, I come back harder
I add the nigga that made magic
When he threw the coke in the pot
So we call him Harry Potter
Time ain't, Estée Lauder
It ain't something you can make up, so wake up
Don't you little drug dealers got cookies to bake up
Only time you'll every cut a cake up
Is during you birthday, these chicos are hungry, these chicos are thirsty
But really it hurts man, in the worse way
To put sludge through people that I used to show love to

Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
Let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
Tell them how you feel

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
Presidential debates unreliable
Politicians want to politick and politrick
That's why I call this shit politricks
I'm a young man, old soul
I can't listen to this new school shit
To me it's just so-so
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
Figure out that riddle and figure out success
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong

Mouth full of golds and diamonds, but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
No te equivoques mi hijito, Miami’ll bring the heat

[Chorus]
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid

One time for Heavy Management, Baja Pantie

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Miami
Where them boys used to touch tourists on a daily basis
Duck charges therefore hardly caught cases
This is a city full of culture and different races
Where all the mami's come fully equipped at young ages
With the hurricanes cause even the biggest hurricane couldn't phase us
We got a dome for the Heat that put y'all to sleep
And we carry hits from night till morning
Like Marino strong armin' the game
But I'm not retiring till I got a championship ring
Poppin champagne simple and plain
Check the map and look where we at
The bottom, simple as that
I'm bringing it back to the fore-front
Like Luke in the 2 Live Crew days
He's the one that's got these mami's going two ways
""Oye""
God bless Uncle Al but knowin him MIA was probably engraved
On the tombstone that stands over his grave to this day!

Them boys throw dubs on Bangis
Kendall got them mamis that taste like candy
OT that's where you can catch Piccalo hollerin 4 LIFE
When I'm downtown I check out the shoe gallery
Cause Danny always looked out for me
Eddie from 24th Street barber shop, kept me out of trouble
I went from the waterboy to the quarterback in the huddle
Callin all the plays I live for, die for Dade
I ride for, lie for, cry for Dade
No if and or buts about it, I'm from Dade
Watch where you hang out in the Grove cause you'll go from
Havin a grand in hand to layin stiff on Grand Ave
I can't forget Liberty City and those notorious pork n beanss
And Scott Projects where nothing's clean
Miami's where we double the money
Cause of course we triple the beams

You know the city of Miami got the country spooked
Y'all got Uncle Sam, we got Uncle Luke
Where the poorest city, according to census report
Thatls cause they didn't count all the bricks that came through the port
Live by the code die by the code
So much cane done came thru this city
We named 40th street Bird Road
Who made Opa-Locka? Who knows
All I know is you don't wanna get caught up in the triangle
After dark trust me bro, trust me bro
Carol City stays Cheifen, Hialeah Mango-hill them chicos stay beefin
Alapatah A.K.A. Dominican town
Dique cause there's nothing but Dominicans now
And to them little Havana boys that hold me down
Bet that up, Wynwood put them up
To all the Haitians from Little Haiti that show me love
Sak Passe gracia dios ya llegue
Now I'm on my way to the top bringin the bottom with me
You got a problem with that
Then obviously you got a problem with me

Have you seen a boricua loco chasing you con un A.K
Hit the wrong way, no amenaces y deja el mensaje
Lo que vayas hacer lo haces y actúa,y ya deja el aguaje
Nos fajamos al gatillo, sino a fuerza de nudillo
Al antiguo, a uno a uno, cara a cara, y sin corillo

How you gon' tell me the sky's the limit
When there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me, I'm good
Half of the world don't like me
Half of the world wanna be me
But believe it or not
That pretty little thing they call Earth needs me
I'm here to show the world
What it is to make something from nothing
Yeah, fo' sho'
I'm here to show the world what it is to do good business
How to blow what I blow
I'm here to show the world that money don't buy happiness
Believe me, I know
But just one thing, once I've showed the world
I just wanna know

I'm tryna inspire the world to show 'em what it is
When you hustle and you work hard

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
Burning up bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
'Cause I'm a winner
Yeah, I'm a winner

[Verse 2: Jamie Drastik]
Sky's the limit, I don't plan on being overlooked
And learn to read before you ever try to throw the book
I did it by myself, exactly how I should
And everything is bad, I turned into good
I'm a magician / wizard with vision
I got a chef that cooks my beef, no kitchen
You like a bunch of females that need attention
And wearing that changes tells me that you [?]
Fortunate fame is the last fame I'm in it for
The ones that we lost all we say you can't win em' all (yeah)
But don't lose in the first place
And every move you make should be a moving to first place
I hope that the tong like soldiers in 'Nam with bombs and firearms
In the middle of Saigon, see that's tightened in the vice-grip
And I'm gone, hit the button on the nightdress
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Jamie Foxx]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
Burning up bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
'Cause I'm a winner
Yeah, I'm a winner

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
There's a choice to be good and there's a choice to be great
There's a choice to fit in or you make your own shape
There's a choice to run the race or you just choose the place
But I chose to take the cake, that's the choice I had to make
See, I made them look like assess
They said I be a failure, No choose the past with
I never listen to the teachers in my classes
'Cause now I'm like a preacher and the way I reach the masses

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
You ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Jamie Foxx]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
Burning up bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
'Cause I'm a winner
Yeah, I'm a winner

Now I'm a marquee brand
Doing business with marquee brands
No more Section 8
Now it's private yachts, beaches, sands
World tours with press and prestigious fans
Just to meet and greet me, damn
Long way from the Miami I was raised in
Long way from that foster home
Long way from that Georgia basement
Long way from all the schools that I was placed in, ha
As long as you work hard and believe
That everything happens for a reason
That's why the world is my chérie, believe it (Wooh)

[Pre-Coro: Yandel, Wisin & Pitbull]
Se monta en el Gallardo, rumbo al tráfico (Heh; duro)
Donde quiera que se mete, se le quedan mirando (Du-du-du, duro; wuh)
Su cara de fiera tiene algo mágico (Ajá; jajaja)
Hace rato que sabe que yo la estoy chequeando (Tres, dos, uno, plah; ¡wuh!)

Bailando en el club, zun, zun (Duro, duro, duro)
Hay química, zun, zun (Duro, duro, duro)

Rompiendo la cadera, velando la zona (Huh-huh, hah-hah)
De día dormilona, de noche mujer Amazona (Huh-huh, hah-hah)

Clarifique con tu amiga y háganme una encerrona
Si se postula, tiene mi voto (Wuh)
De tu cuerpo yo soy devoto
Yo tengo el control remoto (Huh-huh, hah-hah, huh-huh-huh)
Voy pa' tu casa, me voy a meter por un roto
De esa nave yo puedo ser el piloto

La beso, le hablo, me entrego (¡Tego!; dile, dile ahí)

[Verso 3: Tego Calderon, Pitbull & Wisin]
Perdóname el guille, pero Tego es Tego (Dale)
Remix que hago, remix que pego (¿Cómo?)
Que se peleen por el segundo, mijo
El primero tiene nombre y apellido (Jaja; huh-huh, hah-hah)
Compa'i, sin fueta, cosa buena
Alegría pa' tu cuerpo, sin Macarena (Ajá)
Suelta tu melena, llama a to' estos feka'
Lo que está de moda es romper cadera (Okay)
La nena me dijo: ""Guarda la pistola, que aquí no hay pelea"" (No)

Tu movimiento está muy salvaje (Oye; huh-huh, hah-hah)
Igual que mi disco, el que sabe sabe (Okay; woh-pah)
